        "In this project, our focus revolves around an analysis of Elon Musk's tweets, aiming to discern potential relations between his social media activity and the movements in Tesla's stock prices. Elon Musk, a prominent figure with a significant presence on Twitter, commands an extensive following. Despite his massive influence, Musk's tweets have often been characterized as impulsive and criticized for their apparent lack of forethought.\n",
        "\n",
        "One incident that particularly triggered our interest occurred in 2018 when Musk faced legal consequences following a tweet about taking Tesla private. This event served as a catalyst, prompting us to investigate whether Musk's tweets had discernible impacts on Tesla's stock prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before embarking on this project, we undertook extensive preliminary research. Several reputable newspapers had already highlighted the intriguing relationship between Musk's tweets and the stock market, adding depth and context to our exploration. With a keen awareness of the complexities surrounding Musk's Twitter presence and its potential implications for Tesla's financial landscape, our project dives into this intricate intersection of social media, public perception, and stock price dynamics. We are going to observe his growing popularity, the sentiment of some of his tweets while visualizing plots that give us insight into plausible speech keywords that could impact his own Tesla stock price.\n",

        "Twitter may be the fastest social media platform to widely broadcast short messages. Thus, for certain influential profiles with direct ties to publicly listed companies, it is possible that their tweets may directly influence an important segment of their shareholders, potentially impacting their company's stock price. A perfect example of this concept could be Elon Musk, given his high tweet frequency and strong relationship with the tech sector. This raises the probability that his tweets influence a significant portion of his shareholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "As identified by Smith and O'Hare in their study \"*Comparing traditional news and social media with stock price movements; which comes first, the news or the price change?\" (2022)*, there is indeed a reaction to social media messages, particularly tweets, from CEOs by their shareholders and investors. However, the correlation isn't particularly strong according to their methodology. The authors state:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"*... it is still promising that there is some evidence of sentiment driving prices, meaning this may be a good thing to research further. Correlations between sentiment and price movements, where they exist, are most significant on the day of publication, suggesting the impact of the news is short-lived.*\" (Smith & O'Hare 2022)\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors suggest deep learning techniques to identify and quantify further and stronger correlations. A study by Yinghao Ren, Fangqing Liao, and Yongjing Gong in 2020 supports this idea, as their use of deep learning in a short and long-term bidirectional model to extract the impact of news headlines on stock prices shows a statistically significant trend towards investors' reactions when certain words are used and certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, our motivation lies in the idea of selecting the most influential and controversial figures in our era, such as Elon Musk, and gathering all of his tweets in a delimited time span up to 2021. We would tokenize this information to extract only relevant content and use a weighted word model to quantify their sentiment. Finally, we would overlap our results with actual Tesla stock prices, looking for identifiable trends.\n",

just needs some legs the starship launch tower that catches the giant rocket booster is basically mechazilla but wait how is the core of the earth lit by the sun? stop asking questions!! kong vs godzilla has record for most meth ever consumed in a writer’s room @itsallrisky 💯 … going to moon very soon @matsu_kusarine @jagarikin actually happened to me in cyberpunk haha @timbirks1 @erdayastronaut @spacex pretty much @memescryptor ! where is shrek 5!?  https://t.co/pqaz5mg8es @austinteslaclub @owensparks_ @wholemarsblog good point.   next major software rev will do much better with automating wipers, seat heating &amp; defrost.   probable seat settings just based on occupant mass distribution should be possible. @adamklotz_ @owensparks_ @wholemarsblog yup @teslaownerssv @neuralink turns out 🐒 love video games &amp; snacks just like us! it’s all about the cufflinks  https://t.co/elccqc0zuf @chicago_glenn i feel like this sometimes @owensparks_ @wholemarsblog it will @owensparks_ @wholemarsblog remove @w00ki33 @spacex @superclusterhq simulation is improving rendering resolution  … @cleantechnica congrats to nio. that is a tough milestone. @wholemarsblog almost ready with fsd beta v9.0. step change improvement is massive, especially for weird corner cases &amp; bad weather. pure vision, no radar. thanks to all that helped spacex! just read it. book is accurate. @teslagong yeah @mikevanbus @trungtphan @neuralink pretty much  https://t.co/xequrszpvq soon our monkey will be on twitch &amp; discord haha @thenewsoncnbc @contessabrewer good piece! @kyler_knoll @neuralink comes with wireless charging baseball cap @tarekwaked @techcrunch @etherington pretty much 🤣🤣 great episode! a monkey is literally playing a video game telepathically using a brain chip!! @lexfridman @neuralink yes the device is implanted flush with skull &amp; charges wirelessly, so you look &amp; feel totally normal @ihearttesla absolutely doable. possibly as soon as neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3. later versions will be able to shunt signals from neuralinks in brain to neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again @mindofkacper @neuralink yes first @neuralink product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs @ihearttesla @neuralink hopefully, later this year @tobyliiiiiiiiii sure monkey plays pong with his mind @dogeofficialceo @watcherstank @spacex looking at pups soon! @jordanxmajel @watcherstank @spacex shock absorption is built into tower arms. since tower is ground side, it can use a lot more mass to arrest booster downward momentum. @jordanxmajel @watcherstank @spacex load points just below the grid fins @watcherstank @spacex just one skyscraper catching another nbd haha thanks tesla suppliers for providing us with critical parts! @markjam93765764 @ivanescobosa a tidal wave of vaccine is being produced! @jgrano305 probably j&amp;j, but biontech &amp; moderna are good too. some debate imo as to whether a second synthetic mrna shot is really needed, but the first is a no-brainer. @ivanescobosa latter to be clear, i do support vaccines in general &amp; covid vaccines specifically. the science is unequivocal.   in very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an epipen. @davidwillissls @_jevis_ @ppathole needs legs for moon &amp; mars @sciguyspace global payload to orbit is the key metric @julius_burton @erdayastronaut @djsnm @nasaspaceflight @chrisg_nsf @thejackbeyer @felixschlang nice @_jevis_ @ppathole ideal scenario imo is catching starship in horizontal “glide” with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs). @ppathole starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour. @wholemarsblog well-written and fair, much like his articles on space @louisssdev @flcnhvy coming soon. crazy number of launches this year!

@tobyliiiiiiiiii @katlinegrey i recommend propulsive landing, as that is extensible to planets, moons &amp; asteroids. wings &amp; runways are limited to earth. @ppathole @katlinegrey for practical purposes, there is no limit. it will just get increasingly difficult to service. @katlinegrey this a good path, but i recommend aiming for full reusability urgent need to build more housing in greater austin area!

will report conclusions as soon as we know them. starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two @owensparks_ i sure hope so! @owensparks_ agreed! we’re not super far, as magic valley utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for lox (78% of propellant mass)/n2/argon distillation. we’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1mw to 10mw, paired with tesla megapacks, for continuous power. probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome am donating $20m to cameron county schools &amp; $10m to city of brownsville for downtown revitalization. details to follow next week. @adamklotz_ @spacex bn1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. we learned a lot, but have already changed design to bn2.   goal is to get bn2 with engines on orbital pad before end of april. it might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky. please consider moving to starbase or greater brownsville/south padre area in texas &amp; encourage friends to do so!   spacex’s hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly. @codingmark @adamklotz_ @spacex more like v10.0 @adamklotz_ @spacex next major technology rev is at sn20. those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. ascent success probability is high.  however, sn20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact. @adamklotz_ @spacex sn15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. it has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine.   hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. if not, then retrofit will add a few more days. @spacex looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed.   something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today. @spacex at least the crater is in the right place! @spacex a high production rate solves many ills @tesmanian_com demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale semi. this limitation will be less onerous next year. @erdayastronaut tracking to a potential 8am liftoff @wapodavenport that would be great, or possibly via video with full access to telemetry faa inspector unable to reach starbase in time for launch today. postponed to no earlier than tomorrow. possible starship flight tomorrow afternoon @ppathole @nbcsnl trying @chitagranger @frost_367 who is 👌 @nbcsnl nice wholesome memes  https://t.co/u5tkhjua8q @summerlinark we should be laughing our asses off if it’s so damn smart!

@draperyounce wow! @_shameless_plug @falcon9block5 @bluemoondance74 @arstechnica @sciguyspace .@boredelonmusk @wholemarsblog like @cyberpunkgame, but *with* self-driving haha @ppathole @arstechnica @sciguyspace if 2021 manifest is met, spacex will do ~75% of total earth payload to orbit with falcon.  a single starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on earth currently do in a year.   even so, ~1000 starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on mars. @tezlamick @arstechnica @sciguyspace yes @arstechnica @sciguyspace falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. when it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. last year, spacex launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world. @wholemarsblog @herbert_diess fuel cells should be called fool sells! such a silly choice for cars. not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd. @ppathole i was just up there. elevator on the other side. floor is in, glass coming soon. @erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @nasaspaceflight yeah, we talked about that internally. could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. lacks dignity, but would work. but, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster @ashleevance battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. modern airliners are very close to autonomous. @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight there were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   something similar happened on an early falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff. @astro_soichi ♥️ 🇯🇵 @nasaspaceflight fair point. if autogenous pressurization had been used, ch4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. my fault for approving. sounded good at the time. @austinbarnard45 sn10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. multiple fixes in work for sn11. @eurotechjunkie @alpsoy66 @wholemarsblog we will ask the regulators @wholemarsblog build 8.3 of fsd should be done qa testing by end of next week, so that’s roughly when download button should show up @wholemarsblog assuming user approves warning &amp; agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest qa-tested fsd “beta” build as soon as car connects to wifi @cyberpunkgame delamain ai cabs should be able to drive themselves when you’re in them &amp; be electric by 2077 @wholemarsblog … it until you make it @thesheetztweetz not connecting tesla cars to starlink, as our terminal is much too big. this is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp; rvs. starbase, texas  https://t.co/mt4ipqqmjf @harbles it’s all hot air in the end haha @teslarati @klenderjoey still many fine details to address, but the final product will be fantastic. there’s nothing else even close. @wholemarsblog @klwtts haha true. yet, still, so much dignity is ascribed to horses! carnot efficiency of the universe? @engineers_feed ultimately, yes great band, too bad they broke up  https://t.co/vqm7hhhw2m @garyblack00 update probably in q2. cybertruck will be built at giga texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built. @westcoastbill the $1400 is mostly good imo (ubi lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise). @arctechinc should be very soon. many subtle differences between us &amp; canada roads, so harder than it seems. @larrykellogg @arctechinc the tesla fsd computer started shipping in volume in q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have fsd computers, whether or not  ordered as an option. availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or tesla internal development &amp; testing.   note: word “beta” is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. all software is first tested internally by tesla simulation &amp; qa drive teams. due to high levels of demand for fsd beta, adding “download beta” button to service section of car display in ~10 days doge spelled backwards is egod @wholemarsblog beta v8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. will take time to qa internally before release probably in two or three weeks. @somepalegamer 🤣🤣 @ppathole @timsweeneyepic this was way past leg loads. they got squashed hard. if you want the tesla full self-driving beta downloaded to your car, let us know. doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10x size with 8.3. still be careful, but it’s getting mature. @chicago_glenn @timsweeneyepic @trevormahlmann starhopper is an old timer who has seen a lot of things! @timsweeneyepic thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. we’ve never seen this before.  next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues. @timsweeneyepic was super fun tbh haha @jason or is this just fantasy? 🙄 sn10 is in valhalla now  https://t.co/dhy4tdvgni cybervikings of mars @wholemarsblog tesla ai, both hardware &amp; software, is deeply underestimated @renatakonkoly @skorusark 🤣🤣 @skorusark tesla &amp; ford are the only american carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000’s of car startups. prototypes are easy, production is hard &amp; being cash flow positive is excruciating. @jason cgi irl @spacex @ppathole @spacex spacex team is doing great work! one day, the true measure of success will be that starship flights are commonplace. @erdayastronaut @spacex rip sn10, honorable discharge starship sn10 landed in one piece! launch abort on slightly conservative high thrust limit. increasing thrust limit &amp; recycling propellant for another flight attempt today. 5 mins to starship test flight attempt march 3rd starship launch tomorrow. window opens at 9am. @luvmymodel3 @billhuang688 @f9block5 @ppathole yes, beta will be offered much more widely when version 9 is done, hopefully next month @billhuang688 @f9block5 @ppathole fsd beta build v8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. next version is a big step change beyond that. tesla is solving a major part of real-world ai. this is not widely known. @labpadre @spacex you’re welcome @ppathole @erdayastronaut @labpadre @larry_in_canada good point @erdayastronaut @labpadre @larry_in_canada ok, let’s figure this out tomorrow. i’m all for exciting video coverage, but we also can’t have the place festooned with cameras. @labpadre @larry_in_canada first i’ve heard of this. we’ll fix the situation. i’m a fan of @labpadre video! @djsnm indeed it was @f9block5 @ppathole sounds about right, but we want to be very careful with this transition period @ppathole there was still a surprisingly high usage of horses in 1940, but the trend was obvious @adamklotz_ @spacex space from thence to mars, and hence the stars. @nextspaceflight @nasaspaceflight an area much larger than boca chica @wootieztv very much so &amp; its leader shall be the doge   https://t.co/vxmuw5c0y9 creating the city of starbase, texas @pslavi cool @teslaownerssv yup horses are even self-driving!

it would be awesome 🤣🤣 @rjdlandscapes @tesla prices in the us (of all goods) don’t include vat, but it’s usually included in other countries.   then there’s import duty &amp; transport costs.  the intent is that revenue to tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs &amp; transport make up the difference. @cleantechnica 3mm of full hard 301 or 304 stainless is bulletproof to a 9mm or .45 not a meta4, i mean actual books @gjgunit both i admit to judging books by their cover starship to the moon  https://t.co/tvmjbbk3bu @johnkrausphotos sounds like a good idea out on launch pad, engine swap underway  https://t.co/qnxgtl90wn @teslaownerssv probably mid year, but starlink is really meant for those who are least served. bay usually has great internet. you might see much higher download speeds on starlink at times. testing system upgrades. @jeff_foust rockets are ridiculously hard (sigh) @vitothegreat_ i love dogs &amp; memes on the actual moon literally  https://t.co/xbauqivsph @flcnhvy @hsueeugene @teslaownerssv @cleantechnica potentially @teslatino @teslaownerssv @cleantechnica many steps forward, some steps back. yes, we do a lot of qa before releasing a beta version. @_kenh @tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut @ercxspace they will fly there from our launch site.   stationed around the world. @hsueeugene @teslaownerssv @cleantechnica seems likely @teslaownerssv @cleantechnica we’re upgrading all nns to surround video, using subnets on focal areas (vs equal compute on all uncropped pixels) &amp; many other things, so more time needed to write &amp; validate software. maybe something next week.  this is evolving into solving a big part of physical world ai. @cleantechnica interesting @tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut @ercxspace one of them may be in limited operation by end of year @thefavoritist @nasaspaceflight @bocachicagal one of the engines is suspect, so we’re swapping it out @erdayastronaut @ercxspace short-term, ch4 delivered &amp; o2 produced. propellant is ~78% o2. long-term, sabatier reaction to convert co2 + h2o -&gt; ch4 + o2 using wind &amp; solar power. @askdrstupid just a surface detail @ercxspace i hope we don’t go bankrupt building them!

@ppathole @dogecoin just some used antminer l3+ rigs bought off ebay. not really economic, but it was a fun family project. @wholemarsblog most people have no idea, even though there are so many fsd progress videos posted. munro understood right away.   there will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better.  tesla is solving a major real-world ai problem. @dogecoin i just set up some little doge mining rigs with my kids. it was fun. @redditspaceporn 🤣🤣 @peterschiff that said, btc &amp; eth do seem high lol @peterschiff an email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. you might as well have crypto.  money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.  that data, like all data, is subject to latency &amp; error. the system will evolve to that which minimizes both. @chicago_glenn @archillect 🤣🤣 @archillect avocado toast i just want to start a flame in your heart just for a day @nasa congratulations!! @yourlordthanos @waymo 🔥🔥 @realfuckingnews @business somehow, a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods &amp; services!? amazing. @business to be clear, i am *not* an investor, i am an engineer. i don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides tesla.   however, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.   bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. the key word is “almost”. @business tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. having some bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an s&amp;p500 company. @teslarati spacex in south texas &amp; tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant). please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways. @someone3201 @ercot_iso yes .@ercot_iso is not earning that r @mattwallace888 @vladtenev @robinhoodapp you’re right @tesla covered in snow &amp; ice, roads mostly closed &amp; no power in austin @cz_binance @mansourshahrokh there will definitely be a marscoin!

@josh_bickett @ajtourville @erdayastronaut @spacex yeah. by default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good. @ajtourville @erdayastronaut @spacex yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky @adamklotz_ @erdayastronaut @spacex yes @erdayastronaut @spacex it was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land i am become meme, destroyer of shorts @commander_cruz might actually happen sandstorm is a masterpiece @madoverlord we were too dumb next time, we try pull *up* method  https://t.co/j1m7whlrdr low-key loki no highs, no lows, only doge no need to be a gigachad to own dogecoin is the people’s crypto ur welcome  https://t.co/e2kf57klxb @huobiglobal the most entertaining outcome is the most likely doge  https://t.co/vviuzwhodt @erdayastronaut high seas &amp; wind this was a tough one off twitter for a while it will be filled with graffiti art @eiraum мы сделаем giga berlin progress  https://t.co/ekpg5qcbui @hamoon__ @neuralink neuralink is working super hard to ensure implant safety &amp; is in close communication with the fda. if things go well, we might be able to do initial human trials later this year. if you’ve worked on advanced wearables, phones or robots, those skills are needed @neuralink feels weird helping make (hopefully good version of) cyberpunk come true please consider working at neuralink!

dean ono too for kestrel &amp; draco. @tj_cooney @lrocket @spacex @felixschlang @marcushousegame tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of merlin &amp; kestrel, but not later versions of merlin or starship/raptor @ercxspace @smvllstvrs t/w will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. high t/w is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. for expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low t/w. @we5dogg @teslaownerssv no escaping that for me @thebabylonbee read the whole article 🤣🤣 warm, sunny day &amp; snowy mountains  https://t.co/2k8psyqu4j what a beautiful day in la  https://t.co/escjtbzo9d @jaylav_ yeah, dr frankensteen  https://t.co/wdj9k2ujqk @younesh1989 i never used this guy. he gave a talk at spacex once. @flcnhvy only halo  https://t.co/pyrcfe97xp @carnage4life i sure hope that’s not true at tesla or spacex!

@aoc @robinhoodapp absolutely @nasaspaceflight unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the faa space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure.   their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. under those rules, humanity will never get to mars. @evankaylor nomad @anbuteau 🤗 the esthetics of cyberpunk are incredible btw. the interior design is👌. @trevormahlmann @spacex major esthetics improvements coming @teslaownerssv @dmc_ryan a little @dmc_ryan new roadster is part rocket @dmc_ryan @lafebra @gfilche there’s more storage now &amp; easily upgradable @avalonpenrose  https://t.co/djdzxq4maz @couch_investor yes @24_7teslanews @wholemarsblog yeah, probably in a few months @wholemarsblog after you drive without using a prnd stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp; use a shifter!

@nasaspaceflight hopefully, early next week @arstechnica @sciguyspace given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a starlink flight launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow. excited about offering low-cost access to orbit for small companies! @gerberkawasaki they are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. we may need something that’s ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. for now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy. @erdayastronaut @spacex sn9  https://t.co/kwtvwm7mbn @erdayastronaut it’s a good path for fully renewable rocket energy, so solves part of problem, but longer chain hydrocarbons than ch4 are needed to be solid at room temp details next week am donating $100m towards a prize for best carbon capture technology @kristennetten @spacex @eliburton_ @evafoxu @janeidyeve @austinbarnard45 @elonsbrain @jason7patterson @astrojordy @renatakonkoly pretty much @elonsworld @tesla @spacex @neuralink @boringcompany @eashanmisra that would probably mean civilization is doing great, although depends on assumptions for inflation haha @laurenrow5 @evafoxu @renatakonkoly @sarapolak_cz @seanmmitchell @28delayslater @elonsworld @johnnacrider1 @chicago_glenn @xiang_aw he’s everywhere 🤣🤣 @teslatino @tesla absolutely!

@karpathy if they don’t love us, we’re in deep trouble! not everything is made of cake  https://t.co/omacmyqawx @chicago_glenn true haha such a weird game when you think about it  https://t.co/5mrvvzmekg this is not cgi  https://t.co/voive97vpr @bensullins we need a ui overhaul @maldivawow @codingmark @tesla no, these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase. fsd build is a fundamental rewrite, not just in the car, but also our video training/labeling software. @spacenews_inc starlink “poses a hazard” to viasat’s profits, more like it. stop the sneaky moves, charlie ergen! entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves @kimpaquette just meeting with larry ellison to seek some advice. back working on tesla end of quarter tomorrow. @richierichhhhh_ absolutely what should tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world? @ppathole @wsj absolutely @tesmanian_com taste of the future try playing polytopia in your tesla! great game. multiplayer online version coming soon. @wsj focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. this is the good future. @thatdesignguy @m_siphiw @moosuraj @tesla roughly 95% of parts in tesla roadster were unique — not in any other product. unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting lotus elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a lotus. @laurenrow5 @karpathy yes @engineers_feed very important @teslaownerssv @lexfridman ok, service might be able to do this. will check. @teslaownerssv @lexfridman you mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don’t have it? @gunmtlm3 @lexfridman no, but definitely this year @lexfridman good point @conexionspacial @spacecoast_stve @nasaspaceflight interesting @flcnhvy liz has always done great interviews @spacecoast_stve @nasaspaceflight falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. anyone done the math? @karpathy vaccines are just the start. it’s also capable in theory of curing almost anything. turns medicine into a software &amp; simulation problem. @jgrano305 @teslatruckclub @jeremyjudkins @jpuconn @jchybow @dirtytesla yes @teslatruckclub @jeremyjudkins @jpuconn @jchybow @dirtytesla we will offer multiple display options @ivanescobosa @erdayastronaut @teslaownerssv a few more revisions needed. probably beta 10 or 11. @erdayastronaut @teslaownerssv sure @erdayastronaut @teslaownerssv haha ok @kkvr2823 @tesla_adri @teslaownerssv there are subtle, important, differences between us &amp; canada traffic rules, but fsd beta will be extended to canada very soon @tesla_adri @teslaownerssv yes @teslaownerssv we need a “match other traffic speed” setting @stevewoz definitely @flcnhvy @h3_extrachars it’s a step in that direction @13arm13arm it’s one 🔥 or 1/2 🔥 if you don’t have a car with pedestrian speaker. we couldn’t get everything done in time, but more stuff coming. @westcoastbill the writing on cobra kai is sick👌 @afloathickory haha i will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts @h3_extrachars you can upload custom music/sounds @jgrano305 unfortunately, pedestrian speaker is needed, otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn change your horn sound to 🐐, 🐍🎷, 💨 or holiday jingles with latest tesla software update! merry christmas &amp; happy holidays! 🎁  https://t.co/uk6nspwr9r @tesmanian_com great game! @harsimranbansal @heydave7 it will most likely make sense for starlink to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable @heydave7 engineering, design &amp; general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind &amp; are the fundamental limitation on doing more.   capital allocation is important, but low cpu load. tesla public company duties are a much bigger factor, but going private is impossible now (sigh). @elonsworld @real_futurist @lexfridman yes @flcnhvy @marcushousegame a few months @marcushousegame coming soon @olhzn minor @trevormahlmann yeah 12 story rocket turns off its engines &amp; does a controlled fall @erdayastronaut yup, we’re just ironing out a few bugs to tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!! @deepmind @nature frictionless ai. what could possibly go wrong? @heydave7 good idea @wintonark during the darkest days of the model 3 program, i reached out to tim cook to discuss the possibility of apple acquiring tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). he refused to take the meeting. @wintonark strange, if true.   - tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our shanghai factory.  - a monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100x too low. maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack? @archillect sparta’s reply to macedon @lizclaman @tesla @foxbusiness @clamancountdown hi liz! thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make tesla successful. my heart goes out to you. @teslaownerssv indeed @kristennetten it was a seriously twisted affair, but all’s that ends well. @mkbhd they are, although it’s kind low-key. tesla superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars. @michael_saylor are such large transactions even possible? ♥️ i love all u crazy ppl out there ♥️ @bizzzzzyd you have a point (sigh) @pcgamer great game @flcnhvy pretty much. the main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. now, even that’s gone. come for the comments,  stay for the memes💄 @padgeuk absolutely. we will release fsd subscription early next year. one word: doge bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money @hajek_miloslav great nails &amp; lipstick @mightytesla @kristennetten @lauren_kalo @sawyermerritt @jasondebolt @codingmark @28delayslater @babytesla3 @4throwpopcorn @iloveelonandte1 nice  https://t.co/ebojgshvrq @callowaytech sounds about right “lord” edge @xdreamcoding @frank_thelen nice branding just kidding, who needs a safe word anyway!? bitcoin is my safe word @spacex standing down for today to inspect rocket. hopefully launching tomorrow. @spacex pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen tank. review underway. @tesla__mania i am hoping to be back next month! @nytimes very impressive mission by china! @spacex last launch of 2020 coming up @teslaownerssv @astonmartin @tesla he was indeed quite grumpy, but we did not actually know what we were doing, so he had a point @teslaownerssv it will get absurdly good. tesla ai/autopilot engineering is awesome! there’s some great ai out there, but can it self-drive while playing cyberpunk … ? star light, star bright  https://t.co/6cetazsxco @teslarati @13ericralph31 this is incorrect @thebabylonbee 🤣🤣 @pcgamer but it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good @pcgamer a t-shirt being better armor than a kevlar chest plate doesn’t make sense in the absence of magic. also, wish there weren’t level-based item limits in a single-player game. @cleantechnica oh and umm … @cleantechnica i absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare @erdayastronaut @flightclubio the raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. as we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off. @erdayastronaut @flightclubio far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines @picot_john @cyberpunkgame it’s a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great @truth_tesla @tesmanian_com perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. as with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an s-curve. very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic. @tesmanian_com dankeschön brandenburg und grünheide! @austinbarnard45 @lrocket sure hope that future doesn’t come to pass! @tesmanian_com giga berlin-brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world’s most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict. @dota2funny1 @cyberpunkgame original deus ex was incredible, human revolution was also great @cyberpunkgame the objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. this is a much more serious issue:  https://t.co/omncta9hjy @theonion .@thebabylonbee ascent to the heavens  https://t.co/oggsw88yrz @engineers_feed 🤣 @ppathole @cyberpunkgame yeah, briefly. seems pretty good. i picked nomad, so start was a little slow, but picks up fast. seemed like almost everyone on steam was playing cyberpunk at some point this weekend! @zwiebelbach @its_menieb @cyberpunkgame  https://t.co/aayypcpp1i hehe  https://t.co/sklmil3oxt @cyberpunkgame  https://t.co/rhksb40xqr @cyberpunkgame  https://t.co/kmg7c9qf6h  https://t.co/sdmxkbhdzd  https://t.co/qbnt1dused @quantamagazine init void @ppathole @ercxspace @spacex *cooling haha @ppathole @ercxspace @spacex i still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration cooking. in theory, it would use more mass than a tile heatshield, but that remains to be seen. @ercxspace @spacex ship leeward side will be bare metal, windward will have black, hexagonal heat shield tiles @conexionspacial @pockn_cg yes @spacepadreisle @spacex agreed, should be preserved in memory of sn8 @nasaspaceflight @bocachicagal exactly! woohoo!! @erdayastronaut @spacex sn8 did great! even reaching apogee would’ve been great, so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic!! thank you, south texas for your support! this is the gateway to mars. life, the universe and everything  https://t.co/1zczinfc4u @erdayastronaut yeah, engines did great! mars, here we come!! fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high &amp; rud, but we got all the data we needed! congrats spacex team hell yeah!! successful ascent, switchover to header tanks &amp; precise flap control to landing point! @thebabylonbee 🤠 @wonderofscience near-orbital space is the fastest way to travel long distance on earth! @spacex @space_station it’s called the space “station”, but it’s actually moving around earth at ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet “so long, and thanks for the orifice!” - alien message decrypted @spacex probably 1/3 chance of completing all mission objectives @spacex hopefully flying tomorrow @nasaspaceflight yup out on the pad in south texas  https://t.co/rcyoxxptc2 @space_station @spacex wow, station looks amazing! @nasaspaceflight knock, knock, singing telegram! @lexfridman carrying even more symbiotic bacteria (~40 trillion) than cells @adamklotz_ @lexfridman yes @lexfridman we are mobile cell colonies 100 im gespräch mit mathias döpfner    https://t.co/bqa5piaonk @haya2e_jaxa @jaxa_en congratulations! @haya2e_jaxa congratulations! @rdanglephoto @spacex @teslarati yes, it does. @rationaletienne and no toilet paper 🤣🤣 watch demolition man prometheus unbound @ercxspace @spacex @nasaspaceflight @erdayastronaut @marcushousegame @felixschlang not bad @theonion it was a beast compared to the vic-20 @tesmanian_com award accepted on behalf of the great people at tesla, spacex, neuralink &amp; boring co much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a “rocket scientist”, only rocket engineers. latter is who put humans on the moon. science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the universe, engineering is about creating things that never existed  https://t.co/aieuthopxm @justpaulinelol it does get a bit cold at night @engineers_feed paint makes a hell of a difference @deepmind congrats! @lrocket thanks for everything you did to help build spacex! some of the best memories ever. @rgvaerialphotos it will be real soon @marcushousegame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @nasaspaceflight starship legs are one of the hardest problems. externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. wider stance adds mass. shock absorbers add mass. that said, we need better legs. @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @nasaspaceflight static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights @nextspaceflight @nasaspaceflight just a static fire tomorrow. flight no earlier than wednesday. @ercxspace @spacex it will have landing legs @eugenelee3 @ppathole @karpathy yes, very sad news. tony was great. @ppathole @karpathy for a second there, i thought that was a pic of thanos haha @poppa_bearq @id_aa_carmack yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round @dburkland @id_aa_carmack probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks @id_aa_carmack fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what we’re betting on for training with dojo @id_aa_carmack int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great @thisisjendoll but actually!  https://t.co/lb14pksayi @thisisjendoll  https://t.co/mmg5b8b40z happy thanksgiving! @teslaownerssv @johneg78 @teslachillmode @unplgd3 @mfrunker @ccteslaclub hopefully next month @johneg78 @teslachillmode @unplgd3 @mfrunker @ccteslaclub ok. overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. will be linked to fsd, so acts automatically. @karpathy haha true @humanoidhistory the promise is greatly needed @evafoxu we will have special colors for new roadster, as we did for the original @rationaletienne @thebabylonbee 🤣🤣 .@thebabylonbee is savage 🤣🤣 @worldandscience if you ever wondered where we came from this is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal @teslatino @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz yes, but only slightly filled @aholstein404 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz this is a subject of much debate @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz major upgrades are slated for sn15 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz many small improvements, but overall similar. wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc. @thesheetztweetz but that’s why we have sn 9 &amp; sn10 @thesheetztweetz lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance good starship sn8 static fire! aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip. @erdayastronaut @marcushousegame maybe start on that a year from now. depends on how starship progress goes. @rationaletienne @marcushousegame not yet @starshipfairing @marcushousegame not bad! we will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull. @marcushousegame rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary @erdayastronaut @ppathole @teslarati @teslaroadtrip yes @ppathole @teslarati @teslaroadtrip we’re still far from simply video in, control out. the biggest game-changer, currently underway at tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference. @teslarati @teslaroadtrip fsd beta 5 coming out in a few days. improvement should be significant. @xhnews exciting mission! @vincent13031925 @tesla wow @liv_boeree yea tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship of course i still love you @johnnacrider1 @teslaownerssv @28delayslater sure @futurejurvetson @flcnhvy true @rationaletienne @heydave7 @philwhln we have quiet a queue of products to build! better do new roadster at some point😬. @rationaletienne @shycybertruck fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy @icannot_enough @heydave7 yes 😃 @flcnhvy our data center was named skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. might have been tempting fate! @heydave7 @philwhln tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products @nasaspaceflight largest cast titanium part in the world. no heat shielding needed. landing at vandenberg afb in california @tobyliiiiiiiiii @spacex @nasa @nasa_lsp @nasajpl @esa actually, off to the side (so it doesn’t take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship @tobyliiiiiiiiii @spacex @nasa @nasa_lsp @nasajpl @esa where it should be! @philwhln @heydave7 because i am not an investor. tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what i do. but i always put my own money into companies i help create, otherwise it’d be wrong to ask others to do so. well, almost anything quite the day ahead @nasaaero @lockheedmartin now *this* is what you’d call pointy! @cleantechnica cool @astro_fonseca @space_station @wonderofscience @virtualastro they’re moving at ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing @worldandscience  https://t.co/xajan4j9zr @vicentes @evafoxu @ppathole @mirojurcevic @tashaark @space_station there will always be upgrades @evafoxu @ppathole @mirojurcevic @tashaark @space_station it will be better than human vision by quite a margin @enn_nafnlaus @mirojurcevic @tashaark @space_station reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. almost everything except metal is translucent. @ppathole @mirojurcevic @tashaark @space_station exactly @mirojurcevic @tashaark this is a misperception. spacex developed &amp; continues to use lidar for dragon docking with @space_station.   just pointless imo for self-driving. if you’re going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm. @philippecroizon @spacex one day we will fly you on starship @peter_j_beck well done! @hisdirtremoves @spacex i can’t comment on turbopump internal details, but you’re roughly in the ballpark. wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist. @tashaark to be clear, this was just an xpeng problem. other companies in china have not done this. @isaaclatterell @tashaark @karpathy andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented autopilot/ai team at tesla. too much credit comes to me &amp; andrej. @spacetouristuk @tashaark yeah. they stole apple’s code too.  https://t.co/gy4dt7pq9n @tashaark they have an old version of our software &amp; don’t have our nn inference computer @levie wild times! @rocketlab congrats! @slashdot .@theonion @id_aa_carmack yup @flcnhvy change out a few parts, otherwise fine @forbes caution strongly advised with spacs @adamkiotz @suvitruf @archillect sure @suvitruf @archillect haha sexy cropping champion of all time @tweetmenima @teslaownerssv if next week’s release looks good, we will widen beta @justpaulinelol @teslaownerssv unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the us. however, we will be selling the lightning bottle &amp; shot glasses worldwide. @teslaownerssv next week’s release is special. lot of fundamental improvements, both important bug fixes &amp; entire new areas of functionality. @westcoastbill @spacex 13 years &amp; $11 billion … wow @owensparks_ @flcnhvy @tesla safety is our primary design goal @ppathole @astrojordy @flcnhvy fully @astronomiaum let the martians decide their own future @shifthappends @tesla a lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units! @astronomiaum terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. however, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. at least a future spacefaring civilization – discovering our ruins – will be impressed humans got that far. @ppathole @xdreamcoding @garyblack00 that is certainly the intention! @xdreamcoding @garyblack00  https://t.co/frezwjcwna @garyblack00 the only publicly traded stock i own is tesla @garyblack00 wise words from bogle. the point of companies is products &amp; services. they have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you don’t.  https://t.co/yhvqjxtahn @teslaownerssv @astrojordy @flcnhvy no, just a mild cold. same with my bro. def had cov2 though. pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per ml. @astronomiaum life in glass domes at first. eventually, terraformed to support life, like earth. @astrojordy @flcnhvy yeah @daywalker_xd @astronomiaum i was going to say “sim!”, but that seemed too obvious haha @astronomiaum deveras! @flcnhvy and cases with high (non-infectious) ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. second test determines whether they’re just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious. @tobyliiiiiiiiii so many things you want &amp; some you didn’t know you wanted @nichegamer maybe a little mercy …  https://t.co/9ie40hoihr tesla holiday software release is 🔥🔥 @staceyr28715306 @maisie_williams 😏 cobra kai is a deep cut @archillect it’s all cake &amp; someone took a bite @nichegamer there is such a thing as too much sentience deus ex machine learning  https://t.co/5zsyalvczx @peterrhague it’s designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere earth sector activity!   starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current earth rockets combined, including falcon. necessary, for a city on mars. @kristennetten @royalsociety more like he gave it his blessing. it was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in london. nullius in verba @royalsociety @westcoastbill indeed @reflexfunds @nickidk4 @pcgamer dojo/doge @ppathole @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1m for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year @speculawyer @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 exactly @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.   what matters is cost per ton to mars. ch4 is the only choice imo. important: o2/ch4 allows of ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen. @parstalberg @josh_bickett @icannot_enough @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 yes, but from a visiting american. ah, the irony is just too much!! @josh_bickett @icannot_enough @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 yeah, pcr ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold. @flcnhvy @lugg4s1 @pcgamer maybe making some notable changes. will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles. @icannot_enough @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 pretty close. definitely feel 💯 if i take dayquil. frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences i’ve ever had. @lugg4s1 @pcgamer avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad @lugg4s1 @pcgamer about 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. one rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of raptor. @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 the most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! the amount of power going through them boggles the mind. @pcgamer we should just count the atoms at this point @djsnm @erdayastronaut @charlesnotrumps @rweb11742 absolutely. production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. this is true in general. for cars, production is over 99% of the problem. that 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain. @erdayastronaut @charlesnotrumps @rweb11742 our first merlin engine design was really bad tbh. nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great gg cycle engine. @billhuang688 @johnnacrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack maybe *i* just love irony haha @greenisclutch @johnnacrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack they’re on their way! hopefully, more teslaquila next month. @chrisg_nsf special permission received from stonecutters guild!  https://t.co/sw5rbm1srb @johnnacrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack fate 🖤 irony @jack well said. @trylolli @maisie_williams 👻 💵   https://t.co/uwerahxuev @erdayastronaut @rweb11742 damn, that’s not easy! i spent quite a bit of time looking at russian/ukrainian engines. they’re good. @ppathole @michaelmina_lab yes @maisie_williams 🎶 toss a bitcoin to ur witcher 🎶 @kristennetten 😉 @whatsupfranks @michaelmina_lab curevac, moderna &amp; a few others. tesla makes the machine curevac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mrna strands. @michaelmina_lab creating synthetic mrna for cures/vaccines is the future of medicine imo. turns it (mostly) into a software &amp; modeling problem. @gaertner_anne @neuro_skeptic @dresdentea @judith_herbers haha @michaelmina_lab great thread @samtalkstesla i’m ok, thanks for asking. no symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold. ♥️ launch in 5 minutes @flcnhvy yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls the same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety  https://t.co/mr7vfiqwwf thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety @tboneagnoobs ok @klotzadam @ppathole @astrojordy @erujabidi yeah, i feel pretty normal. no symptoms right now. last week, i had symptoms of a minor cold. i’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over. @ppathole @astrojordy @erujabidi doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by rn &amp; am requesting n1 gene pcr cycle threshold. there is no official standard for pcr testing. not sure people realize this. @ppathole @mario_livio both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument astronaut launch today! @mario_livio no kids though @mario_livio hell of a wig collection too @michaelmina_lab it would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing @stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab they should be imo. if you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it’s high/not-high. there is not a clear consensus on what ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”. @astrojordy @erujabidi a little up &amp; down. feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. dayquil rocks. @michaelmina_lab in your opinion, at what ct number for the cov2 n1 gene should a pcr test probably be regarded as positive? if i’m asking the wrong question, what is a better question? @michaelmina_lab @stendeck77 ! @teslaownerssv cool, but please be super cautious. expect two steps forward, one back. lot of new code was merged. @austinbarnard45 just a scratch. we can buff it out. @erujabidi am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely i have a moderate case of covid. my symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold. @whatsupfranks @lexfridman npcs all the way up @lexfridman ahem unless you’re on dmt laws of thermodynamics: 1. you can’t win 2. you can’t break even 3. you can’t stop playing shakes fist at entropy @realnattastic big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks! @robintosh_nunez @ppathole interesting. my thursday night saliva sample came back today with n1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; n3 (generic sars) at 24. i get results of today’s test tomorrow. almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results. @icannot_enough @johnnacrider1 what’s honey? @slashdot feels that way @whatsupfranks @bluemoondance74 @stephenking this seems accurate @bluemoondance74 @stephenking cold symptoms are gone for now 😀🚀💫 @stephenking there are degrees of pos @mrsammy_h @pelagicbird @max_roi @rossy65 heneghan makes a lot of sense. hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the center for *evidence-based* medicine at oxford 🤣🤣. general public doesn’t realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft. @whatsupfranks the number of pcr amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. from what i can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. sound about right? @mrsammy_h @max_roi @rossy65 this a great reference! worth a read. case closed  https://t.co/puyijcadd6 soon  https://t.co/mwopr7w8kk @ppathole fwiw, lab i just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. will talk to several more labs. there must be a graph of pcr amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere. lab i just spoke to said cov2 pcr detection (n1 &amp; n3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not @rationaletienne @ryaneshea note, this is not the spike protein. they don’t consider that reliable. @rationaletienne @ryaneshea just spoke directly to a testing lab. their main pcr search is for the n1 gene, unique to cov2. n3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. high pcr cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max. @ppathole strange @ryaneshea possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. if someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu. @ryaneshea moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. this sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low. @ryaneshea from  https://t.co/42z7vrpb9c  https://t.co/xtsukcc3tl @dana_e_morgan sure is would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the pcr testing industry. what’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 pcr tests? @clarecraigpath interesting @john_beans @dirtytesla interesting what is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 pcr test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles? @ppathole @cleantechnica a good pcr test should identify if i have the cov2 spike proteins, although i have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. hard to get a straight answer.   false positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:  https://t.co/pv6s71jzqo @justpaulinelol @cleantechnica mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. right now, no symptoms, although i did take nyquil. @cleantechnica technically, i tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “elon musk tests negative for covid” is an equally correct title. the “rapid antigen test” from bd seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin. the carousel turns ever faster @joeingeneral @andrewbogut yup @ajtourville exactly @janeidyeve symptoms of a typical cold. nothing unusual so far. @blkmdl3 if it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. i’m getting pcr tests from separate labs. results will take about 24 hours. something extremely bogus is going on. was tested for covid four times today. two tests came back negative, two came back positive. same machine, same test, same nurse. rapid antigen test from bd. @austinbarnard45 burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. we’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @spacepadreisle @austinbarnard45 maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. we need to design out this problem. @austinbarnard45 we lost vehicle pneumatics. reason unknown at present. liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork. @drphiltill 🤣🤣👍 4 astronauts fly to @space_station on sat night from cape. first operational flight of crew dragon.  https://t.co/uzcgikcikb @cardoso luck is the best superpower @hiromichimizuno yes @kristennetten it is an honor that they would choose to work with me. i strive to ensure that the companies enable creative &amp; driven people to reach their potential. such a privilege to work with people i like &amp; respect so much. i feel blessed. @djsnm @davidhuber15 @nickhenning3d @spacex @ercxspace @neopork85 @c_bass3d @caspar_stanley @spacexvision @felixschlang probably @teslany @tesla happy to see this :) @samtalkstesla @tesla i do expect this to become an important product for the world, but probably not financially material for tesla @nickhenning3d @spacex @ercxspace @neopork85 @c_bass3d @caspar_stanley @spacexvision @felixschlang there’s no entry/braking burn &amp; hypersonic angle of attack is ~70 degrees @samtalkstesla @tesla tesla makes the rna bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. curevac has version 2 in use. version 3 is under development. @teslatino checking @pcgamer i just hope this game doesn’t twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled  https://t.co/d0i2w8wnkg yes, you can have my damn cookie! should be a browser setting @teslaownerssv @tesla thanks to a lot of great autopilot/ai hardware &amp; software engineers at tesla! @bbctech for sure @mkbhd @vyyyper will be worth it @mkbhd exactly @model3owners @mkbhd sure @mkbhd actually, it’s still there  https://t.co/2zlkc8fc2d @ed_spartan_117 @tesla @nykchannel wait until you see what cybertruck will do @mkbhd this is accidental. will be back shortly. @erdayastronaut @renatakonkoly @spacenews_inc am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs. will require extreme precision. @vasu42698392 @amyceskridge chip has temp sensor &amp; automatically maintains safe temp @reganlovetesla @renatakonkoly @spacenews_inc enough already on my plate &amp; tesla’s. maybe one day will do a prototype. those are relatively easy. volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100x harder. @amyceskridge neuralink won’t overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. this is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter. @flcnhvy @ppathole @cleantechnica we rewrote all labeling software for 4d. very different from labeling single photos. dojo won’t contribute for about a year. it’s mostly a generalized nn training computer, but benchmark we’re tracking is frames/second. must beat next gen gpu/tpu clusters or it’s pointless. @ppathole @cleantechnica version 1 is about a year away @renatakonkoly @spacenews_inc it would appear that their calculations were incorrect @spacenews_inc china understands the profound importance of reusability. the era of expendable rockets will soon be over. @cleantechnica ♠️♠️ tesla autopilot/ai team ♠️♠️ @cleantechnica good explanation. 4d is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important. the phantom of the opera  is here … inside your mind @linustech @spacexstarlink @spacex 🇨🇦 😀 @ppathole just looking for problem-solvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency. don’t care if or where they went to school. when sending your resume, please describe a few of the hardest problems you solved &amp; exactly how you solved them a new banner is needed neither hard left nor right @ppathole another fine day in the simulation … @nereide faraday invented the electric motor, tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) ac induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor @nereide maxwell was amazing. should have more recognition. tesla motors, inc., was almost called faraday, as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995. 420 is ten times better than 42 🤗 @linustech @spacexstarlink @spacex awaiting approval from canadian authorities recruiting ace engineers for giga berlin! will interview in person tomorrow on site. send resume to 25guns@tesla.com. @chad_hurley @realdonaldtrump @kanyewest stop being a chad @chad_hurley @realdonaldtrump @kanyewest uh … chad wtf @techamazing einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried) @jtrevorchapman yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean @icannot_enough @zainraz4 @vincent13031925 @jonerlichman yes, although i didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon. the reason for the stock options is that they’re needed to help pay for humanity to get to mars in 10 to 20 years. @futurejurvetson @ppathole super appreciate your support, steve! that convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. fortunately, daimler invested $50m in may 2009, 5 months later. @zainraz4 @vincent13031925 @jonerlichman closest we got was about a month. the model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. production &amp; logistics hell. @vincent13031925 @jonerlichman i put in my last money, even though i thought we would still fail. but, it was either that or certain death for tesla. extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like gm &amp; chrysler were going bankrupt. @jonerlichman that funding round completed 6pm on christmas eve in 2008. last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. i put in all money i had, didn’t own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. difficult time. @josh_bickett @ppathole yes @ppathole lowering starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge @itshamzahkhan as soon as we get regulatory approval. hopefully, around middle of next year. @thesheetztweetz right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. no technical knowledge needed. just point at open sky &amp; plug in! @kjell_arne @flcnhvy canada and norway are next after we get us out of early beta! @enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy didn’t realize that was possible. no problem if there’s a way get current design cybertruck approved in europe! @flcnhvy as soon as we get country approval. this is required for each country individually, as no eu-wide approval system exists. probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around feb/march. @jason_rassett lower latitude states need more satellites in position, so probably january several thousand more starlink beta participation invitations going out this week @louiswferreira new design is better with many minor tweaks. even the small details matter. @engineers_feed haha very close to actual expected flight! @nigel_lockyer i could not be more excited about the new supercollider! that said, while it is considerably larger, i don’t think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering. @wholemarsblog @steezyysosa @austinteslaclub @joetegtmeyer @peterdog15 @txterafactory @terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @eliburton_ sure, maybe in a month or so @steezyysosa @austinteslaclub @joetegtmeyer @peterdog15 @txterafactory @terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @eliburton_ well, it’s basically a tank from the future that’s road-legal, so yeah @austinteslaclub @joetegtmeyer @peterdog15 @txterafactory @terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @eliburton_ tesla texas team is making great progress! giga texas factory will be an asskicker. @kyzcralotsxam yes penguin random house 😴 should change the name to random penguin🔥 @austinbarnard45 sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! lot can go wrong, but we’ll provide video, warts &amp; all. you will see every frame that we do. @fnarolles @tgmetsfan98 this is what matters most @erdayastronaut @klotzadam @nasaspaceflight we’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass @flcnhvy @rgvaerialphotos  https://t.co/hez9otgjjh @rgvaerialphotos lord of the … @tgmetsfan98 @klotzadam @nasaspaceflight @erdayastronaut yeah. although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater. @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight @erdayastronaut minor @klotzadam @nasaspaceflight @erdayastronaut understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win @nasaspaceflight @erdayastronaut but, a rud right off launch pad is also possible. fortunately, sn9 is almost ready. @nasaspaceflight @erdayastronaut stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win. @teslaownerssv @kristennetten @teslatino every 5 to 10 days @kristennetten @teslaownerssv @teslatino faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human @teslaownerssv @teslatino we measure this primarily in intervention probability. this update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. true for most beta releases in my experience. @teslatino thanks to a great autopilot/ai team working super hard!   doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. reality is the hardest sim. @auchenberg latency will improve significantly soon. bandwidth too. @teslaownerssv this build should be noticeably better with interventions @rationaletienne @teslaownerssv @toadmeister yes @teslaownerssv @toadmeister i’ve spent more than half my life in california &amp; love the state. but, frankly, i think ca has the winning-for-too-long problem.   like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement. @toadmeister and … sweden is still right with zero deaths oct 29  https://t.co/b0lygotobi @tocnewyorkstate true. also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity. @malekkhelifi24 @9inety6prince @engineers_feed now we’re talking. also, stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation scrotum haha. @engineers_feed small fry. the sun converts over 4 million tons of mass to energy every second. @wholemarsblog accurate @ajtourville @endelsound @grimezsz  https://t.co/2hx6tla8f7 @bluemoondance74 @spacepadreisle some challenges with high winds. looks like sunday for static fire. @spacepadreisle great shot! @endelsound @grimezsz future ai will appreciate this @teslarati truth is stranger than fiction @waitbutwhy 😉 @universal_sci urf is so smōl @homantse28 for a long time truth be told, i’ve eaten at jitb many times over the years, even the teriyaki bowl might buy a jack in the box footstool @skorusark approximately, log(rate) @challengerst same bot, just change setting to “combat” @samtalkstesla well, being a phased array antenna, it is actually rather flat! tesla should make 🔥 catgirl robots? @machinepix little crane: “am i just a toy to you!?” @coffeemaestro_ 🤣🤣 come here … no, come, here 👇 wow, this mayo sure is salty! @ppathole @pcgamer max payne was great on many levels. silent hill good too. jack in the box should do double duty as a sperm donor clinic — name is 👌 @thewpmontgomery @pcgamer one of the best games ever @thatdudeshannon @pcgamer fear 1 with modern graphics &amp; sound would rock @1matthewgarcia @pcgamer ok :) @zzcool @pcgamer all games in this thread are far scarier &amp; more creatively so than any horror movie @pcgamer fear 2 is best imo. also dead space 2. they will haunt your dreams. @rakyll  https://t.co/p1agokwqpv @jgrano305 @flcnhvy to the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.   most of the factory had no equipment at all! even light bulbs were missing in some areas.  gm &amp; toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories. @flcnhvy all that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. but we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life. @flcnhvy and there were actually zero employees in the factory after gm/toyota left. they took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. it looked apocalyptic inside. @ajtourville bettern nothin or ur 💰 back! @wholemarsblog 💫 🛰 @hyperchangetv tesla team has done great work! @hyperchangetv well, tbh, our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash 😬 @westcoastbill testing for covid is a license to print money @arctechinc @tesla yes, very helpful. thanks all beta testers! @erdayastronaut video training &amp; inference is essential for excellent autonomy @engineers_feed sigh … there should be a new supersonic jet, this time electric @worldandscience critical to humanity’s future congratulations spacex team! @teslatino mine is a few days ahead @eliburton_ @teslaownerssv sure, it could be an option in settings @teslaownerssv visualization will tone down significantly for production. these are intentionally strident colors. @erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @superclusterhq sure @erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @superclusterhq i’m in boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. given that starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @superclusterhq good point. probably next week in form of a written piece on spacex website. @austinbarnard45 @superclusterhq great pics! that we now have the beginnings of a starship production system is most meaningful. @wholemarsblog yup. with beta updates, there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast. @bart_sanders working on it. also needs to be able fart at other cars on command. @spacepadreisle starship is coming together! price change is pushed to thursday next week. applies only to us for now. one week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. fsd monthly rental will also be available sometime next year. @austinbarnard45 there will be a 360 deg glass star bar (name tbd) at top of high bay @dmc_ryan well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. how much time do you think we should give? @stephenking agreed. are these performance tires? @spacex just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case. @flcnhvy sure now that tesla fsd beta is out in limited release, fsd price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on monday @teslagong @ppathole @teslaownerssv @tesla_raj as soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. so many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human). @ppathole @teslaownerssv @tesla_raj yes @teslaownerssv @tesla_raj haha @teslarati dependent on proving high safety @wholemarsblog not intentional! we just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire us vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in nevada, a single state. tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. we also found a way to extract lithium using nacl (table salt). @erdayastronaut cold gas for now, hot later @rubix161 i mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar … starship nosecone, high bay &amp; tiki bar  https://t.co/9qxyxmmiuj @ieeeorg … @erdayastronaut after it gets to orbit a few times @erdayastronaut got a little melty tbh :) @erdayastronaut those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything, but i’m confident raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights. @erdayastronaut raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mt-f sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.   r-boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. will need bigger pumps. fsd beta rollout happening tonight. will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should. data from 3 engine starship static fire this morning looks good. proceeding with nosecone mate. @ppathole @toadmeister yes. we also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease. @toadmeister sweden at zero deaths oct 15  https://t.co/gy9a20ummx @joshtownsend_96 yes @juanjacobs @jwangark firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes @ppathole @flyerandyp @mojosusan mobi-c has too much mobility, fusion has too little. we need mobi-d haha. @flyerandyp @mojosusan actually, it’s my neck …  https://t.co/2vcoaxsrv3 @flyerandyp @mojosusan maybe i can be helpful. had mobi-c disc put in at c5-c6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. recommend using yelp or other online reviews of doctors. effectiveness varies widely. @jwangark pretty accurate. it’s not so much dna sequencing as it is using synthetic dna/rna to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack. @samtalkstesla london to beijing would be cool @samtalkstesla wow, that would be quite a trip! @cinotpyrc that’s my kid haha møtør trèndé @techamazing looks like snoopy @tesmanian_com current production is slightly better @bamtheteslaman1 @cleantechnica doesn’t seem to be any life in this solar system. maybe under the ice of europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of mars. worth reading:  https://t.co/ym0d53hgys @cleantechnica very creative @flcnhvy that free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts ~4 million tons of mass into energy every second. we just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization. @kristennetten @teslaownerssv you never know @ppathole after @xbox 😢 @whatsupfranks @kimpaquette also, system should autodelete old data automatically by default @univercurious table in tension @kimpaquette yes @teslaownerssv starting production on 7 seater next month, initial deliveries early december the gauntlet has been thrown down!

significant improvements coming to the welds. @gem8mingen @tesla congratulations! @teslarati making progress 9 meter or roughly 30 ft diameter will be less roomy with 3 vacuum rocket engines added  https://t.co/pktdfdizyc @flcnhvy @wholemarsblog @kristennetten @boringcompany @tesla it’s still there, but focus is vegas &amp; prufrock, our new tunneling machine @astrojordy @kristennetten @boringcompany @tesla for sure @wholemarsblog @kristennetten @boringcompany @tesla maybe a month or so. some finishing touches need to be done on the stations. @kristennetten @boringcompany @tesla we simplified this a lot. it’s basically just teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds. @playoverwatch sweet … @antonkanerva yes. everything is slow to a phased array antenna. @lexfridman nice “what is love? baby don’t hurt me.”— winston churchill @playoverwatch @twomad or maybe 2 weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom @playoverwatch @twomad please buff torb’s turret! @twomad um … yes @teslaownerssv i have goosebumps 2 merch. not sure how tbh. @teslaownerssv hg2g @teslaownerssv lotr 🤘 the illuminaughty 🤘 @chotihaque @billgates @dougstanhope @bobdylan @charltonbrooker @ericidle @jimcarrey @johncleese @sapinker knee deep @chipro yeah @wr4nygov at least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time! @bad_at_life @wholemarsblog diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he’s in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. no way to make everyone happy. @flcnhvy good grief! spacex is getting zero money for this. starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around earth (also to moon &amp; mars). vast majority of use will be civilian. it’s just like an airline in space. all airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian. @teslarati with fsd, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. this time, it’s right. @rationaletienne @28delayslater thank you, much more accurate haha @28delayslater this graph appears to be upside down @teslarati sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual. @teslaclubin @cleantechnica will release order configurator probably in jan @cleantechnica limited fsd beta releasing on tuesday next week, as promised. this will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers. @shortword @jwangark the soc’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of nns that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant @jwangark tesla fsd computer’s dual socs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 tops, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one soc (or engine in this analogy) fails. @jwangark accurate analysis. quite a few  ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. neither mobileye nor nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements. @ppathole @slashdot ! @ohiotesla @jendunlap_ @tesla @caranddriver @teslaownerssv @teslarati @electrekco glad jen is safe! @ppathole @slashdot wow @slashdot uh ok, here we go … @teslarati i don’t think this is accurate @erdayastronaut @mariabartiromo @potus @realdonaldtrump @jeffbezos @morningsmaria @foxbusiness yeah, there are literally &gt;1000% more cameras than 10 years ago, but still zero clear photos @tesmanian_com even if half that amount, it’s still a big deal! @enn_nafnlaus @electricfuture5 🤣🤣 @mariabartiromo @potus @realdonaldtrump @jeffbezos @morningsmaria @foxbusiness i have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting earth. fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count! @electricfuture5 we face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. it’s not a question of money. if there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. this is solved in the fsd build. @flcnhvy definitely @enn_nafnlaus exactly. he plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as i know). i went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. @enn_nafnlaus there are sketchy edits to tesla wiki that whitewash eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. pretty odd. i was interim ceo/co-ceo from july 2007. michael marks was co-ceo for ~q4 2007 &amp; ze’ev drori for q1 to ~q3 2008. after q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be ceo. @enn_nafnlaus when eberhard was fired from the tesla ceo role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. that says it all. @carrenimfa interesting @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @pellebrannvall @neopork85 @caspar_stanley @ercxspace @marcushousegame @felixschlang @c_bass3d @nickhenning3d @spacex @bocachicagal spacex/tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level @teslaownerssv @erdayastronaut probably @erdayastronaut i have that exact art on the wall of the place i stay in boca chica! @rationaletienne @toadmeister yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo. @toadmeister sweden was right  https://t.co/bzc2lfdjzq @erdayastronaut @pellebrannvall @flcnhvy @neopork85 @caspar_stanley @ercxspace @marcushousegame @felixschlang @c_bass3d @nickhenning3d @spacex there are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside. also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what i’ve posted. and yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what i’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer! @teslarati great work by spacex valve engineering &amp; production! @neopork85 @caspar_stanley @ercxspace @marcushousegame @felixschlang @c_bass3d @nickhenning3d @spacex our tiles are mechanically attached @flcnhvy @neopork85 @caspar_stanley @ercxspace @marcushousegame @felixschlang @c_bass3d @nickhenning3d @spacex it might be used in some areas. itar laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions. @neopork85 @caspar_stanley @ercxspace @marcushousegame @felixschlang @c_bass3d @nickhenning3d @spacex tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. a very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal. @id_aa_carmack compilers need to improve imo. most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user. @rgvaerialphotos @spacex i’m proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha @sdg2030 @anandmahindra @metnigeorges @eriksolheim @berniehollywood norway leads the world @nasaspaceflight passed cryo proof @johnkrausphotos @superclusterhq @spacex 👍 @ajtourville yeah, it’s not a contest. advanced casting crushes best-case 3d printing, but casting doesn’t work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys. @astro_farmerbob @astro_pettit @astrokomrade @astroannimal great pics! @johnkrausphotos @patreon @superclusterhq @spacex maybe this should be the flag of mars @tashaark additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   it’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. to the best of our knowledge, spacex is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive. @renatakonkoly @franktinsley @ankitxupta @tashaark pretty much, but i think it may end on a high note @evhq2 @tashaark meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. won’t need to wait for fsd. @evhq2 @tashaark it should be @franktinsley @ankitxupta @tashaark exactly. we barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once. @picklepunchd @ppathole @tashaark yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣 @zainraz4 @ppathole @tashaark yes @ppathole @tashaark yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler @tashaark waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. the tesla approach is a general solution. the latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. will release limited beta in a few weeks. @akidesir @kristennetten yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5% @ercxspace @spacex @erdayastronaut @marcushousegame @felixschlang great render. note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster. @kristennetten mimecraft @teslagong @teslatested yes @icannot_enough @teslatested autopilot team is making great progress. reality sure is complicated! @ercxspace @marcushousegame @brendan2908 @bocachicagal @nasaspaceflight aspiring to have no flame diverter in boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake @eugenelee3 @marcushousegame @brendan2908 @bocachicagal @nasaspaceflight we do have giant steel balls haha @teslatested we just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one @ihearttesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @wholemarsblog i definitely need to try these tasty cakes &amp; pastries on my next visit! @marcushousegame @brendan2908 @bocachicagal @nasaspaceflight mass ratio. liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane, even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point. @ihearttesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @wholemarsblog had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of tacheles. too bad that place got torn down. it was awesome. @ihearttesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @wholemarsblog döner kebab @tribehoh @spacex @wastatecommerce you’re most welcome! @brendan2908 @bocachicagal @nasaspaceflight high bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. super heavy stacking should begin around then. @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @wholemarsblog that looks tasty! @tesladri @chananbos @raytech247 @wholemarsblog the crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair @icannot_enough @wholemarsblog sandy munro understands engineering @flcnhvy @teslaownerssv @raytech247 @wholemarsblog that would be like licensing battlestar galactica. actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. lots of people who worked at tesla gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one. @teslaownerssv @raytech247 @wholemarsblog yes, the gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product @chananbos @raytech247 @wholemarsblog battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. this is a *major* breakthrough. @raytech247 @wholemarsblog but now we understand production much better. it will be our primary competitive advantage long-term. @raytech247 @wholemarsblog even gm &amp; chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. ford and tesla are the only us car companies that have avoided bankruptcy. @raytech247 @wholemarsblog the model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for tesla. no us car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. @evafoxu @wholemarsblog bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. you do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly. @skorusark marginal cost of starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. fully burdened cost depends on flight rate. @wholemarsblog prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. takes much longer than people think to climb the production s-curve. i can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part. @wholemarsblog we do expect to make heavy use of lfp for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage @wholemarsblog berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. also, a new paint system.   lot of new technology will happen in berlin, which means significant production risk. fremont &amp; shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven. @astrojordy @wholemarsblog they are @wholemarsblog i do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart @ppathole @klod_ua @erdayastronaut @trevormahlmann @johnkrausphotos @mike_seeley 7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. this was a proof test, rather than a burst test. we’ll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest. @klod_ua @erdayastronaut @trevormahlmann @johnkrausphotos @mike_seeley cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking @erdayastronaut @trevormahlmann @johnkrausphotos @mike_seeley one of the best shots ever! @samtalkstesla @spacex much sooner @mdcainjr @spacex @45thspacewing @nasa great photo! @dirtytesla @spacex it will soon @spacex once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern us &amp; hopefully southern canada. other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval. @flcnhvy @alvianchoiri we’re not seeing notable differences yet. i think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. maybe turbopump hot sections. @ppathole @alvianchoiri roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. starship super heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour. @alvianchoiri ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year. 4th flight &amp; landing for this booster 5 minutes from launch. looks good so far. @cleantechnica so crazy to subsidize pollution! this is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe. @sciguyspace it’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market. turn volume to 11 &amp; play powerglide in your tesla    https://t.co/l07yc02p7g @teslaownerssv fsd will solve these issues music volume on a tesla goes to 11, because it’s louder than 10   https://t.co/ab5hamo3en @kristennetten @flcnhvy one of my favorite writers. foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential. @orionsgauntlet 💯 @christianserino  https://t.co/glnevuneyl rewatched young frankenstein this weekend. still awesome. ovaltine?  https://t.co/wimdyfsuiq @flcnhvy the remake has the potential to be great. i kinda liked the original tbh, but it’s possible to take it up a level. hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials @cleantechnica this article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10x long-term @samtalkstesla @teslaownerssv @ppathole @rationaletienne @stevenmarkryan @kristennetten @wholemarsblog pretty wild, considering that exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago new spacex droneship will be called “a shortfall of gravitas” nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!) @id_aa_carmack would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while it’s driving @model3teslaj coming soon call of booty, great game  https://t.co/hyfszsrm6m @teslaownerssv @spacex vector-space bird’s eye view coming with fsd @ppathole @spacex unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator @erdayastronaut @spacex all of that and more. we’re doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range &amp; regulatory constraints this weekend. i will also be at the cape next week to review hardware in person. @alandail @spacex exactly @spacex we will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!

it will be increasingly difficult to see starlink satellites, as we’re actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded. @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight @bocachicagal @thefavoritist the ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling. @mkbhd it’s next-level @fox10phoenix 💰💩🤣 @officialalishap @flcnhvy @tesla glad to hear your mom is ok @zshauladventure @nasakennedy @ulalaunch @spacex @natreconofc good to see. inspiring for future of space!

the circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds. @model3owners @futurejurvetson @cfs_energy @cup_plasma @mit that’s very hard to do. have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? it’s designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic. @futurejurvetson @cfs_energy @cup_plasma @mit it’s cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but i suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky) @austinbarnard45 weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming starships @ppathole haha true. why do showers have such a wide range!? @evafoxu !! @rationaletienne @wholemarsblog yes @univercurious @physicsj light is not as fast as you’d think @samtalkstesla maybe we used too many magenta spotlights @valaafshar @tesla having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety @vm_one1 @waemd @spacex we will probably ipo starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. i’m a huge fan of small retail investors. will make sure they get top priority. you can hold me to it. @perezshivam @waemd @spacex fate loooves irony haha @waemd @spacex glad spacex could help! we are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no internet connectivity at all. @austinbarnard45 true @teslavibes that’s total market, not all tesla. we do see tesla reaching 20m vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution. @cashmoneylemon @cathiedwood @skorusark total market @cathiedwood @skorusark seven years for sure to 30m+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. five years is possible, but unlikely. an extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials. @flcnhvy @cathiedwood both will do original cars @cathiedwood we aren’t cutting the price of model 3 to $25k. i was referring to a future car that will be smaller than model 3. @brian_heide @tesla what about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails? @pickenheim @matthew_kerle new version coming soon @wholemarsblog suppliers. we’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. also, maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard.  https://t.co/r1sox7vta8 @teslagong @drsallyl @sydney_ev @_teslatom @teslastraya @outbacktesla @ev_outback @michael01996367 @cvanderstock @teslaownersau @ahillfromoz @rjo71342 @evhq2 @michadru29 @dunkenkbliths if it passes australian regulations, then sure @scottadamssays 🤣🤣 @flcnhvy @kristennetten checking into it @kristennetten totally up to you, but if you head to a tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool @id_aa_carmack completely agree @erdayastronaut yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! no more hydraulics. thanks tesla team for great work on deliveries! for new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics. @scottadamssays there are times when i feel like i’m living in a dilbert cartoon @artifactshub that species has stood the test of time @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight @austinbarnard45 @ppathole mostly 304l, some 301. broke at 301 to 304 interface. sn9 will be all 304. also, we’re making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture. @nasaspaceflight @austinbarnard45 @ppathole 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. it’s enough. improvements in work. @ppathole we just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high mach. first flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft nosecone &amp; front flaps next week. sn9 next month. starship sn8 with rear body flaps  https://t.co/gdxmbzx0ct @waitbutwhy  https://t.co/v6us36yho6 @muratpak sure @evafoxu true @hisdirtremoves @spacex not bad @enn_nafnlaus @ajtourville exactly @ajtourville @munroassociates sandy munro understands engineering @darealwamos turns out they mostly press the letter s &amp; 💩 on the typewriter 🤣  https://t.co/kaarajvl2b centaur with a bow obviously  https://t.co/cfkfkffxp0 @justpaulinelol @evafoxu haha @evafoxu something like this  https://t.co/ndvuumms67 @ajtourville can’t support 3 wheel vehicles. not safe enough. @rgvaerialphotos ~9007mm @marlonsix60 something appealing about hawking/hartle idea, but i agree with turok/feldbrugge/lehners @muratpak 🖤 ur algo @ppathole @marlonsix60 true @ppathole @erdayastronaut there are some practical size constraints too. can’t be too big to fit in the engine compartment. but, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec isp would be nice. @ppathole @erdayastronaut doesn’t seem to be a problem. we could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure. @marlonsix60  https://t.co/gzljmnyciu @djsnm preburners ignite, then main chamber @marlonsix60 where is our prediction of probability inaccurate? @marlonsix60 or energy &amp; time, but besides that what? @podcastnotes genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus what can’t we predict? @tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut yeah, but might not need it @erdayastronaut 107 expansion ratio. you can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle. only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid  https://t.co/rhuwk20egg @xiang_aw @wholemarsblog this does seem like the opposite of open. openai is essentially captured by microsoft. @wholemarsblog haha true @oneandonlyheady maybe i will … @techamazing @univercurious jets are so cool @flcnhvy @gfilche @yahoofinance pretty much @1stprinciples4l @gfilche @yahoofinance yes @gfilche @yahoofinance yahoo finance is as dumb as it sounds @icannot_enough yes @neopork85 @spacex haha @tobyliiiiiiiiii @tesla roadster will be better @ppathole probably cybertruck, atv, roadster &amp; semi c a r s  https://t.co/4aq1a5cykh @futurejurvetson @hiromichimizuno thanks for your many years of support through very tough times! @icannot_enough @wholemarsblog we will be a little below that this year (most challenging year we’ve ever had), but probably above that next few years @wholemarsblog that’s about right. maybe a little faster. @umutcnbostanci yes @teslaownerssv cgi irl @tobyliiiiiiiiii @caranddriver @tesla haha the extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. it’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. the machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself. @nasaspaceflight @bocachicagal haha we intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from panasonic, lg &amp; catl (possibly other partners too). however, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves. important note about tesla battery day unveil tomorrow. this affects long-term production, especially semi, cybertruck &amp; roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022. @evafoxu thanks! @neopork85 @spacex @marcushousegame we really need better legs for starship. they’re coming. @neopork85 @spacex @marcushousegame most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. there may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend. @model3owners fine, we’ll do it already 😀 @arkinvest @tashaark good analysis, although i think we should wait until fsd is a bit more mature @singing__surfer i’m pretty sure tesla could do a much better autocorrect. the bar is so low haha. @lorenzoteixeir4 @zog_fot_pik @samiralyateem @id_aa_carmack true @igorantarov @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling @teslaownerssv @jgrano305 @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack ok @flcnhvy @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack pretty much any machine-learning @jgrano305 @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack it’s big @zog_fot_pik @samiralyateem @id_aa_carmack sure @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack yeah, we will open dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs @samiralyateem @id_aa_carmack there are a lot of pointless zeroes in fp32 neural nets. you can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. this works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision. @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a gpu cluster. could be wrong, but i think it will be best in world. @llamaa35079089 @id_aa_carmack @tesla you really want waypoints this much? @id_aa_carmack for dojo, we’re betting on fp16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like fp32 &amp; existing software just works. we considered fp8 for a while, but everyone hated it. i even asked twitter! for inference, int8 works great. @wholemarsblog yes @babytesla3 @wholemarsblog yes @wholemarsblog there’ll be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. the “open” areas inside are covered. they’re internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building. @savedtesla @peterdog15 shaped like a diamond &amp; aligned on true north a prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required, but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. we will teach you what’s known about the brain, which is not much tbh. if you feel neuralink might have incorrectly overlooked your resume or declined to  make an offer, please lmk in comment below @teslaownerssv @model3owners @trungtphan felt i had done enough on the internet (zip2 &amp; paypal) that my work would be useful to others. needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary. @model3owners @trungtphan it took an utterly insane amount of work to move the spacex &amp; tesla success probabilities above ~zero @trungtphan to be frank, in the early days, i thought there was &gt;90% chance that both spacex &amp; tesla would be worth $0. the press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me. @fermatslibrary irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers of course i still love you @deborahpatteri @tenetfilm sure, but which planet? @tenetfilm good movie @erdayastronaut current was too strong for droneship to hold station. thrusters to be upgraded for future missions. @chrisdungeon lot has happened in 13 years @teslarati it will be very insane speedrunning factorio in real life … @cleantechnica no, but you make some great points. important to note that iron’s cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. that said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem. @coderfoot @m2jr @berniesanders yup fallout shelter is on your tesla. tap the entertainment button. @m2jr @berniesanders implicit conflation of consumption &amp; capital allocation is the foundational error @kristennetten great idea!

@valaafshar tunnels are the solution to traffic. you can have as many levels as you want. usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for new york or beijing. @matthewcable6 @ercxspace just a guess, but probably mid teens. booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. we’ll build several ships just to improve the production system. @ercxspace pretty accurate simulation, although sn8 will use 3 raptors. if sn8 craters, sn9 &amp; sn10 are close behind. high production rate allows for fast iteration. @teslavibes couldn’t agree more — major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming @cleantechnica definitely not. smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterday’s technology, neuralinks are the future. @engineers_feed seems like they should make a whole outfit out of that material @sama ancient greece had it all &amp; then committed suicide. nobody digs your grave better than yourself. @flcnhvy @sama true @historyinpics the lego movie was awesome @sama the story of civilization. first book is a little dry, but second book, the life of greece, is incredible.  https://t.co/46lbcix7fi @erdayastronaut i’m wearing your f-1 engine shirt right now!

it’s so much work to create our own tech. we develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to. @teslarati tesla germany designed &amp; built the vaccine rna printers for curevac, but, subject to some curevac ip, they could be made for other companies too @engineers_feed technically, james watt measured a pony, added 50% &amp; rounded up haha  https://t.co/vnko0mtruc @flcnhvy @gerberkawasaki also, critical thinking @flcnhvy @gerberkawasaki alexander and the rise of hellenism and film studies @gerberkawasaki wow, i super loved astronomy (but took it at queens, not penn)! definitely one of my favorite classes. senior year quantum mechanics at penn was the hardest class i ever took. that stuff will mess with your mind. @teslaownerssv @justpaulinelol yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at caltech/cern. very basic stuff.  https://t.co/ci2dzegjcb @justpaulinelol it’s too embarrassing just learned that my physics prof from penn is head of fermilab &amp; still has some of my old homework ☺️ @ruskin147 it is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. for example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard. @l_vaux @kulpability @tlowdon @ethicalskeptic people are extremely unlikely to die of covid/sars-cov2 alone. if you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect. @ppathole @kulpability @tlowdon @ethicalskeptic that &amp; giga berlin are why i’m headed to germany this week. conversations with harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed rna printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas. @tlowdon @ethicalskeptic antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. in a study that spacex did working with harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory t cells  https://t.co/z9wlvijotw @ppathole @tlowdon @ethicalskeptic yeah @kulpability @tlowdon @ethicalskeptic one person at tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. i called his wife &amp; hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was. @tlowdon @ethicalskeptic some of the tests we initially tried at tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. too many testing methods were approved too quickly. wouldn’t blame the fda, though. public was demanding fast test approval. @wholemarsblog @marcushousegame @neopork85 @spacex @erdayastronaut @spacetoday1 @elonsworld @felixschlang @chrisg_nsf @djsnm not yet @marcushousegame @neopork85 @spacex @erdayastronaut @spacetoday1 @elonsworld @felixschlang @chrisg_nsf @djsnm yes. this is the hardest part of the booster design. @icannot_enough people read too much into this level of detail. it’s not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level. @icannot_enough critical feedback is always appreciated btw @biogirl09 @janeidyeve @tesmanian_com @spacex we can’t have a blanket pass, but maybe for some events @neopork85 @spacex @marcushousegame @erdayastronaut @spacetoday1 @elonsworld @felixschlang @chrisg_nsf @djsnm booster design has shifted to four legs with a wider stance (to avoid engine plume impingement in vacuum), rather than six @flcnhvy @ppathole @id_aa_carmack later versions of a larger device would have that potential @evafoxu @waitbutwhy yup @ppathole @id_aa_carmack actually c, although the syntax could be improved esthetically @id_aa_carmack i like c, because it avoids class warfare @ppathole @ieeespectrum @neuralink a nightcap would probably work best @ieeespectrum @neuralink pretty much @tesmanian_com good summary conceptual telepathy ahem … starting soon “all of physics is either impossible or trivial. it is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial.” e rutherford @flcnhvy giant gap between experimental medical device for use only in patients with extreme medical problems &amp; widespread consumer use. this is way harder than making a small number of prototypes. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @djsnm testing with shorter rvac skirt went well. full length skirt test coming soon. neuralink product demo in 3 hours. webcast at  https://t.co/y9wred78oj. @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @djsnm raptor reached 230 mt-f (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust. @nextspaceflight good chance something will slip, but, yeah, sunday is intense @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @djsnm only need 2 engines @astrojordy @flcnhvy @djsnm boring co tunnel in vegas is only a few months from being operational @flcnhvy @djsnm neuralink this month &amp; tesla next month, spacex probably october. we will have made a lot of progress by then. might have a prototype booster hop done by then. @zeitmas @djsnm soon @djsnm they’re quite accurate! @evafoxu that number sure comes up a lot 🤣🤣 @ajtourville @peterdog15 i’m fine with reasonable drone footage. just needs to be at a fair distance &amp; not coming right up to people. i think our security was a little overzealous in this case. @gerberkawasaki @tesla thanks to a smart and hardworking team at tesla. these sure are wild times … @teslarati much appreciated. this was a serious attack. @thejackbeyer @nasaspaceflight brave starhopper carried the day @itmotivatesus only so many days @waitbutwhy  https://t.co/19h4u8ta2a @wholemarsblog we were too obtuse for our own good, although i think it works esthetically. those are folded-over current collectors at the top/bottom of the cell, which are important, but i don’t want to jump the gun on sept 22 … @cleantechnica but actually nothing. was surprised to hear they’re across the road. adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. we already do. question is just what ratio of silicon to carbon &amp; what shape? silicon expands like crazy during discharge &amp; comes apart, so cycle life is usually bad. @cleantechnica nothing 👀 @lexfridman then they leave the house and hardly ever call their parents!

if you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though. @ajtourville @comma_ai @tesmanian_com dojo v1.0 isn’t done yet. about a year away. not just about the chips. power &amp; cooling problem is hard. @spacecoast_stve scorcher vi  https://t.co/34o80p1hi6 @antonioetayo @erdayastronaut @c_bass3d @nasaspaceflight @felixschlang yes elevator music is underrated @erdayastronaut @c_bass3d @nasaspaceflight @felixschlang it’s counter-intuitive, but raptor has so much thrust at high isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. that said, hot gas beats the heck out of n2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds! @nextspaceflight payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for f9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you’re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3 @zubinanary @spaceintellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages yes, it will have huge nuts haha @teslarati we really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. guaranteed to make a party more fun. works well with flamethrowers!

 https://t.co/kvkrwksvab @erdayastronaut yeah, starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. hard to see with naked eye. we’ll do lots of flights. @c_bass3d @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight @felixschlang very impressive render. note, legs will be bigger &amp; there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing. @ppathole @universal_sci this might sting a little … @ppathole the “early investor” part of tesla is wrong. that bs has been pushed by eberhard (worst person i’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years. @universal_sci also, there could be long period comets that intersect earth right now. we just haven’t observed them during humanity’s (very short) recorded history. comet s-l 9 punched a roughly earth-sized hole in jupiter.  https://t.co/ne7dm0yaxx @universal_sci pretty much cybertruck option package @stevestuwill @jagarikin wow @booster_buddies @nasaspaceflight my button-twiddling makes no sense at all 🤣🤣 @flcnhvy @nickcappelli @grimezsz you got it  https://t.co/f2rxgcz964 @evafoxu that’s a great one “tanks 4 the memery” - panzer of the lake some big milestones coming up @drphiltill africa is big @awardsdarwin bold move, sir, bold move @euricsanti @luisabinader @tesla thank you, tesla is most honored!

@teslarati a little toastier each flight @flcnhvy same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending. sn7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. sn8 will have body flaps &amp; nosecone. sn 5 &amp; 6 at starship production complex in texas  https://t.co/8bvrd5vdu7 @mark_goldberg_ @tesla one day soon, i will wear this outfit  https://t.co/t0snf4ugyk @mark_goldberg_ @tesla i was trying to channel herb tarlek from wkrp  https://t.co/0rc72s0zay @mark_goldberg_ @tesla note the fabulous plaid jacket &amp; gingham shirt combo 🤣 @archillect twin peaks @samtalkstesla working on my mom’s cousin’s farm in saskatchewan at age 17. i think we did a barn-raising that day. @wonderofscience  https://t.co/y7lrlouxr9 @erdayastronaut not sure yet, but hopefully. will need leg &amp; other repairs. probably sn6 flies before sn5. we need to make flights simple &amp; easy — many per day. @lexfridman clearly @ramacvr @kristennetten @ppathole @berniesanders also true @kristennetten @ppathole @berniesanders 🤣🤣 @ppathole @berniesanders over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. from the first financing round, where i owned ~60% of tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3. @rationaletienne @berniesanders i wonder if he reads his twitter feed @berniesanders and why aim your attacks at tesla, when we’re doing more than any other company on earth to advance green/sustainable energy? have you read the news?  https://t.co/34tzbk5tiv @berniesanders that bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. bernard sanders is a docile puppet of big oil!

i should credit soviet/russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from h2 to ch4. they demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with isp up to 380 secs. wort reading the whole thing  https://t.co/4lyav7kis4 @jgrano305 @icannot_enough @gerberkawasaki @tesla @joerogan we shall see … @flcnhvy @gerberkawasaki @tesla @joerogan maybe i should retweet the top four or five point. what caught your eye the most? @flcnhvy @gerberkawasaki @tesla @joerogan good point! @icannot_enough @gerberkawasaki @tesla @joerogan yes @gerberkawasaki @tesla (formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative &amp; political bias about almost everything. reading major newspapers makes you feel sad &amp; angry. that’s why they’re being crushed by @joerogan. likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. ironic article:  https://t.co/78uftw0p6t @univercurious size matters @xkcdcomic sure seems that way 🤣🤣 @chriswarriner @flcnhvy bad incentive structure @theonion 🎶to meme the impossible meme 🎶 @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut we’re working on new legs. wider stance &amp; able to auto-level. important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky &amp; pitted surfaces. @erdayastronaut forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. if goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. no need to bring early ships back. they can serve as part of moon base alpha. @erdayastronaut absolutely @jimbridenstine @commercial_crew @nasa outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. the difference in results will be incredible. wow, this is extremely important!! @lance210 🤣 @ppathole @tesla autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. what seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential. stankonia at  https://t.co/ljjcd7bagx @emmerichvideo @tesla good point @engineers_feed and those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke @latestinspace @esa mars has an amazing amount of water ice @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight 81m @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight yeah. even stacking on the pad will be quite an adventure!

@kulpability @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @valkyriebaron11 @nasaspaceflight no, but it’s mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6) @sspencer_smb @flcnhvy it’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal. @flcnhvy to be clear, i do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the us go into those fields. also, too many mbas. @raytech247 @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @valkyriebaron11 @nasaspaceflight yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for mars (best case) @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @valkyriebaron11 @nasaspaceflight would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of mars @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @valkyriebaron11 @nasaspaceflight starship + super heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% o2 &amp; 22% ch4). i think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. with high flight rate, probably below $1.5m fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg. @kristennetten @lexfridman @joerogan 🤣🤣 @esecrist50 @kristennetten @erdayastronaut @yoavoffek that’s pretty much what happened. the cows weren’t sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other. @clairlemon @quillette a mandatory tracing app would be insane @andrewfosterwa1 @killasarg @erdayastronaut @elonharith @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight true @teslaownerssv @vincent13031925 @joerogan probably makes sense to have a “details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason. @vincent13031925 @joerogan franz and i do have absurdly similar tastes 🤣🤣 @godmiller1 @johnnaaaaaaaaaa @evafoxu @tesla would cover latitude of london @clay_ellis @tesla yes @teslatino peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. aiming for latency under 20 ms. @johnnaaaaaaaaaa @evafoxu @tesla it will only work for higher latitudes (seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator @johnnaaaaaaaaaa @evafoxu @tesla sure :) @evafoxu @tesla way more important than it sounds @gavinnewsom yeah!! @erdayastronaut @valkyriebaron11 @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond earth. propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc. @erdayastronaut @elonharith @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight sls makes me feel sad @whatsupfranks @nasaspaceflight no, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded @flcnhvy @nasaspaceflight yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine @abauerle5 a great mystery of the universe @nasaspaceflight it’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @yoavoffek roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky! @ppathole @erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @geetpurohit3 @yoavoffek looks about right. ice mining/refining  on mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. co2 is easy, as mars atmosphere is mostly that. also has good amount of n2, which is important for life. @erdayastronaut @yoavoffek in this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid @erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @geetpurohit3 @yoavoffek yes, converts co2 &amp; h2o to ch4 &amp; o2. perfect for mars!

importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated. @jh_csquared @alexbrendel2 @erdayastronaut as usual for most things, building production system for raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it @renatakonkoly @erdayastronaut @spacex it’s also because of the spitfire engine &amp; wizard @ppathole pretty much. being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term. @jgrano305 @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica progress is good @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica definitely @cleantechnica many talented engineers are working on fsd at tesla. what matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation. @dmc_ryan @renatakonkoly sure, we can probably do an update later this year @kristennetten @ppathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers needs to be more than halfway to east coast @ppathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers not saying new giga will be in texas, but cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as fremont is at max capacity @renatakonkoly yes @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers yes @shelbiestrykers i agree mythic quest is 🤣🤣 mttd @polyrhythmic mean time to dick is a key measure of any given human or machine intelligence system @erdayastronaut @spacex merlin is very simple compared to raptor @yourfavgas @vencikudev @tesla width currently limited by size of cold-roll press needed to get steel to full hard condition. bigger press will be built long-term. @vencikudev @tesla absolutely great questions from hack club!

@togregto frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so @togregto not the greatest use of money @anime_virus @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @mfrunker if this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites … @thirdrowtesla @mfrunker thanks! we are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9. @thirdrowtesla @mfrunker makes sense @nichegamer nice @jgrano305 @ppathole @supernova_style anything surprising? @ppathole @supernova_style numbers i was told from wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. those are not good odds. @supernova_style when i talked to doctors in wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators &amp; in favor of non-invasive @supernova_style no kidding … @chrisg_nsf @nasaspaceflight good article @ppathole @anniew am in boca working on the rocket with an awesome team, so pretty great :) @anniew 🤣🤣 @brendan2908 @cleantechnica definitely header tanks &amp; nosecone on sn5, hopefully flaps too. definitely flaps on sn6 @cleantechnica crazy times!

@teslaownerssv @erdayastronaut fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then mars @peter_j_beck @thesheetztweetz @ulalaunch @torybruno @spacex 10% would be impressive. anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding. @erdayastronaut i sure hope so! this will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as apollo did. it wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind. @whatsupfranks @flcnhvy another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. media keeps reporting former, not latter. @inspacexitrust @jgrano305 maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. still very roomy. @jgrano305 probably 3 to 6 months @flcnhvy moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. if they put boris johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! this article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points  https://t.co/5cpq29wovu @flcnhvy you’d think they’d at least be wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! it clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. it’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.  https://t.co/whkaq9177v @ppathole @nichegamer my kids loved that one when they were little @nichegamer 🤣🤣 @spaceforcedod @af_academy congratulations again!

😅 @erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee @rocketlab @peter_j_beck i have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! it’s very hard. i’m spending crazy hours on starship design/production. it is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. sn4 is almost done 😀 @ppathole @fat__tire @kristennetten @robotbeat @ghotiing @cruizvinicius @josh119872 @sweetinxs @votelabonte @erdayastronaut @tesla my (again) personal favorite is  https://t.co/rm1mqsvsr1 @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee @rocketlab some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/mars. that said, it’s probably right move for small leo vehicle. @fat__tire @kristennetten @robotbeat @ghotiing @cruizvinicius @josh119872 @sweetinxs @votelabonte @erdayastronaut @tesla vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! my personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% o2.  https://t.co/pepvji56vg @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @sivanithu @erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee sn26 @cabral_psyd @sivanithu @erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. it’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to raptor! @ppathole @robotbeat @ghotiing @cruizvinicius @josh119872 @sweetinxs @votelabonte @erdayastronaut @tesla the way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. even ny is giving them away! @erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee fundamentally, atlas is still dependent on russia to launch @erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee yeah, atlas main engine is russian. great engine, but not us. also, their fairing is swiss. i think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not us. @robotbeat @ghotiing @cruizvinicius @josh119872 @sweetinxs @votelabonte @erdayastronaut @tesla tesla actually sent out resmed, philips &amp; medtronic units. latter is fully intratracheal. my personal opinion is that some icus are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting peep &amp; o2 too high. high pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.  https://t.co/2iuns5dpog @erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee sorry, meant to say only us rocket. atlas v is close, but not yet 100%. @davidmholtom @nu23ro @sciguyspace tesla *was* saved by an investment in may 2009 from daimler, not govt. without that daimler support, tesla would have died. super appreciated! @davidmholtom @nu23ro @sciguyspace exactly. in mid 2009, tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by bush in late 2008. first actual disbursement was q2 2010, long after bk danger passed. loan was repaid early with interest. taxpayers made money on it!! @thesheetztweetz @sciguyspace @some1gee last i checked, over a million dollars less. moreover, f9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully nasa-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. @sciguyspace @some1gee also, it costs less $ to insure a falcon 9 mission. that’s the acid test. @sciguyspace true. only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ula is powered by lobbying. to be clear, fremont &amp; shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop initial production at giga berlin is model y @brandonbernicky you will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern @justpaulinelol there’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot! giga berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature @thirdrowtesla this will happen @ppathole @thirdrowtesla we stole that from cheetahs @thirdrowtesla in case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from spaceballs @sofiaan @thirdrowtesla there’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. i guess we could answer some powertrain questions in q&amp;a. @thirdrowtesla just battery day, but it will be great. plaid powertrain will be later this year. @jp_obrien 五輪書 while others party, he study the blade  https://t.co/fbxedij78m @tesletter dayquil or nyquil? happy easter!

yeah, we’re going to reuse much of the thrust section. @erdayastronaut @ppathole @austinbarnard45 @labpadre exactly. no point in an abort system on mars, so got to make the core ship super safe. @erdayastronaut @ppathole @austinbarnard45 @labpadre rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. however, this can be made very safe over time imo. @erdayastronaut @ppathole @austinbarnard45 @labpadre there are redundant pressure control valves. it’s a new system and sn3 was simply commanded wrong. rockets are hard. @erdayastronaut @ppathole @austinbarnard45 @labpadre if you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in we’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the tesla! @ppathole @austinbarnard45 @labpadre pretty much. good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. not enough pressure in the lox tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the ch4 tank. this was done with n2. @henryfordnews @tesla 👍 press any key to continue  https://t.co/gfnlyougdy @nychealthsystem @tesla you’re welcome!

more available if needed. @erdayastronaut @spacex @flightclubio mass of initial sn ships will be a little high &amp; isp a little low, but, over time, it will be ~150t to leo fully reusable we have extra fda-approved ventilators. will ship to hospitals worldwide within tesla delivery regions. device &amp; shipping cost are free. only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. please me or @tesla know. @teslarati @bocachicagal the legs extend &amp; telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for sn4+ @neiltyson one day we will @marsmeditation @rationaletienne @ppathole the s-curve appears to be entering the logarithmic phase @rationaletienne @ppathole  https://t.co/js68gnys2u  https://t.co/4a3h517zdw @ian1219 ok @renatakonkoly  https://t.co/pwb6ivya0j @c3lt_games hopefully, starship will have enough flight history to substitute for dragon for nasa missions too  https://t.co/bvh1tl12l6 now on launch stand  https://t.co/yb5wiejakj @teslaownerssv seeing friends hello from the inside  https://t.co/sv3fwl3bkp logarithm graphs coming soon  https://t.co/fc81tdsqgc @guardian magnetic personality @microdentist and many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving c19 @n2179_twit @abbottnews this sounds great @abbottnews can you do a fast antibody test? @scottsaoralba yes would be great to combine blood donations with a c19 antibody test, so you know if you’re immune. refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind. @ppathole @vitalvegas buzzfeed is a mind virus @vitalvegas also makes for a great shelter  https://t.co/f991ajd2mu @alexsafahi @nycmayor we will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them @kshah07 @yosefontwo @jsellmafia @nycmayor yes. just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed. @nycmayor biggest value tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the icu where &amp; when they’re needed. there are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues. @nycmayor you’re most welcome. credit to the tesla team. will do our best to help in any way. @archillect dragonfire @thirdrowtesla 🤣🤣 @thirdrowtesla exactly. douglas adams knew what he was talking about. @brianswails @thirdrowtesla stop!

@kristennetten @thirdrowtesla yeah, pretty much. house could talk to car &amp; know when you’re expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. no wasted energy. @romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @teslarati this is a way bigger deal than most people realize @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @teslarati sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; hepa filter @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @teslarati yes. pcb design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. octavalve is pretty special too. team did great work. no credit to me. @ajtourville @teslarati the heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond @teslarati model y heat pump is some of the best engineering i’ve seen in a while. team did next-level work. @justpaulinelol @engineers_feed 🤣🤣 @bocachicamaria1 will do @teslaownerssv @renatakonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @quillette most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed c19 case growth rate this week. follow chart at bottom of this cdc page:  https://t.co/vz3pbhqihg @renatakonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @quillette exactly @jonkay @quillette according to the italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to c19. this is a significant policy difference in italy vs most other countries. @engineers_feed engineering ftw @flylaxairport much appreciated @ppathole @bbcsciencenews have you seen more data on hcq &amp; z-pak? hard to find. @bbcsciencenews worrisome @thirdrowtesla yup @johnnacrider1 @thirdrowtesla we’ll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. n95 masks are a pain to wear btw. less onerous masks are better most of the time. @kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @salehcu yeah. we have a mask shipment stuck at lax. hopefully freed up soon. @engineers_feed nice @johncleese this is great advice @uwdrwaldorf @tesla @omead_a @uwmedicine thanks for taking delivery in your garage! let us know if there’s anything else you need. @justpaulinelol @evafoxu @tesla we expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part. @evafoxu @tesla supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other ppe to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from er physicians @nativecacv @tesla @omead_a you’re most welcome. we’re working on getting other types of ppe too. ventilators should arrive within a few days. @benikbeno @cdcgov panic is always dumb @guruleaks1 @benikbeno italy: “on re-evaluation by the national institute of health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.” @cdcgov close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of c19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors @jennerator211 we have n95 masks &amp; getting paprs. will have our team reach out. just had a long engineering discussion with medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. very impressive team! @samtalkstesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @natesilver538 no problem :) @samtalkstesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @natesilver538 sigmoid (s-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. containment reduces asymptote of s-curve. at this point, we have strict containment in us/europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to china. @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @natesilver538 sigmoidal for china, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world @lauren62515251 @ppathole @natesilver538 fair point :) @riccitellidylan @coldbuschlights @ppathole @natesilver538 exactly, both would be false positive. also, dying with c19 is different from dying because of c19. vast majority who died had other illnesses too.  https://t.co/ykmw54q2kl @ppathole @natesilver538 up to 80% false positive @ppathole @natesilver538 sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. just a spike in demand right now. also, using cpap machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand. @natesilver538 do you have data on the false positive rate? i’ve heard a wide range of numbers. cdc numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”.  https://t.co/vz3pbhqihg @natesilver538 important consideration @friedberg feels like the plot of deus ex  https://t.co/r8tmw048jm @mg42bonesaw a single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk @renatakonkoly @moskov yeah, spacex is working on ventilators too @moskov that won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our us factory can’t stay open @edludlow yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though i think they probably won’t be needed @alandrummond2 interesting thread @dofaquarius @ppathole thanks 💖 @cernovich china is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of tesla shanghai @dofaquarius @ppathole we’re working on ventilators, even though i think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter @flcnhvy anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. those seem most important. @rationaletienne @ppathole  https://t.co/eltga3hrar @rationaletienne @ppathole kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky. @ppathole based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in us too by end of april @ppathole yes no new domestic corona cases in china  https://t.co/lgmxrvmyfy @westcoastbill imo, this professor is correct. also, growth rate of confirmed c19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10x increase in testing. from tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. track this chart:  https://t.co/vz3pbhqihg @nycmayor @natesilver538 sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs @m_mosseri @spacex @nasa @nasa_astronauts yes @disruptresearch @jason true @jason exactly. my guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already. @natesilver538 tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. spacex makes spacecraft with life support systems. ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now? @suhaylabbas @fawadchaudhry we will make ventilators if there is a shortage @cleantechnica  https://t.co/9xvratnhnq @cleantechnica some helpful data from italy  https://t.co/3taxq5nxcz @cleantechnica monitor graph at bottom of cdc website. new “confirmed” cases, not oft-reported “presumptive positive” is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of april. same pattern as china.   https://t.co/vz3pbhqihg @cleantechnica 0% chance of anything close @challengerst @worldandscience 🤣🤣 @riganoesq @diderraoult how does this compare to favipiravir?  https://t.co/rm1mqsvsr1 @erdayastronaut @sciguyspace yeah, that will be a great milestone 😀 @erdayastronaut @sciguyspace last launch aborted due to slightly high power. possibly, but not obviously, related to today. this vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn’t a big surprise. life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. won’t risk non-spacex satellites. @kmastersbarnes @spacex yeah, most reflights ever! @sciguyspace yeah. there was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. shows value of having 9 engines! thorough investigation needed before next mission. @evafoxu 🤣🤣 because polygon doesn’t rhyme @annerajb yeah @ppathole awe tow co wrecked abysmal autocorrect might be the #1 reason people don’t fear ai fear the memesphere @nichegamer wild times … @j_potoski @adrianagalayda @ppathole @1971capital @mlevitt_np2013 exactly @nichegamer seems to be happening a lot @1971capital @mlevitt_np2013 very sensible. knows how to handle exponential functions in reality. @riganoesq @diderraoult whether z-pak works in this situation or not, it’s a kickass med for many maladies  https://t.co/um2tqypzqz @mikefthomp if jamis needs help, he has many friends, me among them @fael097 pretty close. design is evolving rapidly. would be great to flatten domes, embed engines &amp; add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. also, current legs are a bit too small. hydroxychloroquine probably better  https://t.co/fwn2kh1lzx  https://t.co/wqodhifewt @ppathole sounds sensible that said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. if we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses. track graph at bottom of this page:  https://t.co/7nwkjizyfn this paper matches what i’m hearing from a lot of smart people  https://t.co/vul3xorsgq @ppathole @sofiaan @renatakonkoly @meckimac yeah. fate loves irony. @sofiaan @renatakonkoly @meckimac what’s worse is that i even told stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite &amp; they still couldn’t find it! @sofiaan @renatakonkoly @meckimac yeah  https://t.co/yp3pbn4prv @renatakonkoly @meckimac i was first misdiagnosed at stanford hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at sequoia. a visiting doc from san jose general saw my charts &amp; sent me to icu immediately. i was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. so, i take expert advice with a grain of salt … @meckimac was also given a lot of doxycycline  https://t.co/hn0bzsiatz @gundament maybe helpful @meckimac yes, i received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. had near fatal case of falciparum. would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. doesn’t mean it works for c19, but maybe better than nothing. maybe worth considering chloroquine for c19  https://t.co/leyob7jofr @engineers_feed 👍 @erdayastronaut @spacex @boeingspace @ulalaunch @boeing slight booster length increase to 70m, so 120m for whole system. liftoff mass ~5000 mt. fear is the mind-killer @tesla congratulations giga ny team! @janeidyeve some parts will use 304l, as it has higher toughness at cryo temps. will move to internally developed alloys probably end of year. @bluemoondance74 @eugenelee3 @ianpavelko @bensullins probably. raptor sounds different to merlin. @bluemoondance74 @eugenelee3 @ianpavelko @bensullins lot of raptors coming through!

@neiltyson yes, it’s in my twitter banner pic we should be excited about the future &amp; striving to go beyond the horizon! @nichegamer good one @ppathole that’s the goal! 😀 wacktivism! and so annoying moral condemnation used not for morality, but as a weapon for manipulation is messed up moon too the people have spoken! @teslatino @tesla checking  https://t.co/ixso7ko4z7 @samtalkstesla @janeidyeve mars is god of war &amp; memes are a form of war … and fun too! neither will be destroyed. ceres, moons of jupiter &amp; saturn prob come next. @janeidyeve sure to those who quietly help advance the causes we mutually believe in, knowing advancing the cause is the only reward: thank you @rationaletienne thank you for your kind words, brother @fredericlambert former model y production for east coast too scouting locations for cybertruck gigafactory. will be central usa. @evafoxu @autozeitung @tesla ⚡️ with an epic sound system &amp; woofers the size of a car @_sear_ @balabushkafury definitely @jaden @coachella ✌️ @balabushkafury and rammstein @thirdrowtesla haha true @flcnhvy @coachella yes, for now @coachella ok fine, that was good haha tesla should have a mega rave cave under the berlin gigafatory @kristennetten lucent dossier in 2011 &amp; i think i saw @grimezsz in 2012 but didn’t realize who it was until later @djslimeball busted 🤣🤣 @trevorcochran2 🤔 was good maybe 5 or 6 years ago when you could wonder around &amp; find great unknown bands too much corporate sponsorship killed the vibe coachella should postpone itself until it stops sucking @nichegamer ben &amp; jerry’s cookie dough is also next-level. can’t have that in the house. it’s too good!

@fxzzonthebeat virality of c19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe! @war_remains @hardcorehistory thanks for taking us through this today. hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality. @cosmicdatabase yeah accurate envelope expanded @alejandro_debh recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. if this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason. rocket will land in highest winds ever at cape canaveral tonight. this is intentional envelope expansion. final dragon version 1 mission tonight the coronavirus panic is dumb @tesla raising art to new heights @chrisdungeon also, when tech is new, catalog engineering isn’t possible, as there is no catalog. has to be first principles. @sciguyspace 💕 @justpaulinelol @erdayastronaut @sofiaan @tesla we’re making progress. improved rules are going through the eu standards committees. hopefully better in a few months. @erdayastronaut @sofiaan @tesla cool, we’re tracking to release more fsd features later this month @sofiaan @tesla true. oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order fsd. perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the fsd option is ordered even after delivery. mad respect for the makers of things bernie’s tax rate is 0.2% too high!  https://t.co/esaqayl9xb @teslarati no matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. manufacturing is underrated. sleeving sn2 dome in the high bay  https://t.co/zdruogd8xz they have the best coin dogs rock  https://t.co/vljgyzo5sx ✌️ bro  https://t.co/nj7cuyhr2j @techau track mode v2 is pretty cool. maybe too complicated to use though? lmk thoughts for improvement. @erdayastronaut @jack this is vital just want say that i support @jack as twitter ceo. he has a good ❤️. @vincent13031925 definitely  https://t.co/yt0zkj1r5j @flcnhvy @janeidyeve we’re stripping sn2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure, first with water, then at cryo. hopefully, ready to test in a few days. @janeidyeve there’s a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. don’t shuck the puck! where’s flextape when you need it!? it’s fine, we’ll just buff it out so … how was your night?  https://t.co/tbjdyiqjxd @annerajb @realemirhan yes, dramatically improved imo @annerajb @realemirhan we need to finish work on autopilot core foundation code &amp; 3d labelling, then functionality will happen quickly. not long now. @realemirhan 👀 @universe_skyart @twittersupport i just sent a note to twitter to clarify that posting spacex videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to bowie song for the falcon heavy launch @leehudson_ @lockheedmartin the competitor should be a drone fighter plane that’s remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. the f-35 would have no chance against it. @teslarati it’s not that big really @spacex testing raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design @newscientist it’s not mine @foxfire40900590 definitely! what’s in that sky city thing!?  needs a prequel even more than a sequel. @erdayastronaut @janeidyeve @jakethehuman28 @tesla_truth @twitter sure @janeidyeve @jakethehuman28 @tesla_truth @twitter posting spacex videos is definitely not copyright infringement! @j_brorsson @teslarati hopefully, in march. checking … @teslarati i had no idea this existed. sounds awesome though! @rationaletienne @bryr32 full disclosure, i’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. it’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries! @bryr32 we had the wrong settings! to make the welds super flat &amp; strong, we’re building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement. @flcnhvy yes @justpaulinelol 3 on sn2 sn2 tank integration starts this week with much less circumferential pucker. thanks fronius!

model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 epa sticker in consumer reports testing  https://t.co/5hqrhjp4bv @ppathole @erdayastronaut @teslarati yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact @erdayastronaut @teslarati it’s slightly better @nichegamer definitely worth trying imo @teslarati btw, in some prior tweets i’d said production cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). this is slightly too small. will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights. @teslarati active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio science has gone too far  https://t.co/ky65q3s3jx 🔭  https://t.co/6hhgr0zvp0 @flcnhvy @sciguyspace f9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. little change is expected going forward with f9/fh or dragon. starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than falcon. driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year! @ppathole @johnhanzl it’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. after delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs. @johnhanzl sorry, meant to say lox header tank in tip of nose. ch4 main tank is above lox main. @johnhanzl lox @sciguyspace these problems are fundamentally intertwined. building many rockets allows for successive approximation. progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations. @sciguyspace hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%. @flcnhvy @sydney_ev probably @sydney_ev attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow starship to the launch pad @rationaletienne i rate it two bugblatter beasts of traal up! high bay for stacking starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!  https://t.co/g9h0430ns2 @pentaquarky @erdayastronaut the whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit @tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut there will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. it will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. they were fine. @ppathole @erdayastronaut header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters. @erdayastronaut o2 header tank is tip of nosecone, ch4 header is in the main ch4 tank @tesletter in the order that they were written worth reading asimov’s foundation  https://t.co/ozfhcnnzyg @tobyliiiiiiiiii sn 2+ will have better fit &amp; weld quality. later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length. @tobyliiiiiiiiii the persuader hammer will fix sn1 rocket nosecone production in texas  https://t.co/klwewja9gn @archillect  https://t.co/yk4xuubcpw @mattredlon @neuralink yes @kitty_mcconnell glad you’re all ok!

@emmonstein no problem. snow and ice tend to slide off the tesla solarglass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles. @_mantis_ sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. this pic is brand new. @_mantis_ ok @g_d_photographr sounds like we should open a tesla center there! please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of tesla solarglass roof! critical feedback is much appreciated. @yourfavgas probably 6 months or so. 301 is certainly fine for orbit, but spacex 30x will be better. midsection of starship propellant tanks  https://t.co/aa8ykpjefs @revoeh020 @tesla yes, but we want to focus on textured black first, then move into earth tones &amp; convolutions @samtalkstesla your comment above: “who in their right mind would buy an ice after 2025 knowing its residual value will be zilch? legacy auto: go ev or go bust!” is super important for car buyers. residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years. @rationaletienne haha foundation by asimov mars is to earth, as terminus was to trantor @samtalkstesla europe &amp; china timing will be announced soon @teslaownerssv many bay area installations are ongoing now hard to believe that is high efficiency solar power seamlessly integrated into beautiful roof tiles. great work by solarglass engineering, giga ny factory &amp; tesla installation teams!

was a fun recruiting event. great to see all the excitement about helping build starships. @teslarati @13ericralph31 unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for sn1 orbital design. optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter. @nextspaceflight @chraveesh @teslarati no, they’re sn1. sn2 to follow shortly. aiming to be a little better each time. @chraveesh @teslarati yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area @teslarati that said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume. @teslarati this isn’t quite correct. an orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3x to 4x better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. suborbital is much more forgiving. spacex started with a mariachi band party. great vibes here in boca chica, texas!

going max hardcore on design/production starship here in boca. it’s awesome! feels a bit like a mars simulator. @justpaulinelol @reto_siegrist @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla definitely! @reto_siegrist @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla yes 🔥🔥🔥 @cathiedwood @sbarnettark @jwangark @arkinvest first, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. from initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. as with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards. @flcnhvy @tesla @thirdrowtesla ok sure 😀 btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as usa only. also, work location can be bay area (preferred), but austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any tesla gigafactory. @teslagong @indiealexh @mojosusan @blkmdl3 @elonsbrain @cathiedwood @arkinvest intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities i’m unaware of @indiealexh @mojosusan @blkmdl3 @teslagong @elonsbrain @cathiedwood @arkinvest true, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature @teslagong @elonsbrain @cathiedwood @arkinvest it will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. there is no other way to do it imo. @dofaquarius @cathiedwood @arkinvest wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. it’s *awesome*. @elonsbrain @cathiedwood @arkinvest probably this summer @ajtourville @cathiedwood @arkinvest yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! not hard to be way better. @ppathole pytorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library our nn is initially in python for rapid iteration, then converted to c++/c/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). also, tons of c++/c engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test. @cathiedwood @arkinvest the profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. just needs to be unequivocally better than utah array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks. @thereal_psyche sorry! @samtalkstesla a phd is definitely not required. all that matters is a deep understanding of ai &amp; ability to implement nns in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). don’t care if you even graduated high school. @john_gardi not needed, but will be very useful on mars due to light speed latency tesla will hold a super fun ai party/hackathon at my house with the tesla ai/autopilot team in about four weeks. invitations going out soon. we are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both palo alto &amp; austin dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. more on this later. our custom 144 tops in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every top is useable &amp; optimized for nn, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with “at tesla, using ai to solve self-driving isn’t just icing on the cake, it the cake” - @lexfridman   join ai at tesla! it reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. my actions, not just words, show how critically i view (benign) ai.   https://t.co/if97zvyzrz @flcnhvy @astronomiaum unfortunately, this is true. it doesn’t matter how skilled you are if you’re trapped in a giant bureaucracy. @renatakonkoly @nichegamer @justpaulinelol desperate times call for desperate measures … @astronomiaum only 66 years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. this must change. @marialauraadr @justpaulinelol @nichegamer haha true @nichegamer @justpaulinelol the safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of google search results! @nichegamer @justpaulinelol trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren’t being paid to push an agenda or scam. google still shows bs/scam pages, they’re just several clicks away. @justpaulinelol @nichegamer this was a huge problem for search engines until google applied the citation relevance principle aka pagerank, among many other things  https://t.co/qsfqtpfzb2 @justpaulinelol @nichegamer report as soon as you see it. troll/bot networks on twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement. @nichegamer the crypto scam level on twitter is reaching new levels. this is not cool. @marcelmeijer @tesla yes @engineers_feed we should make buildings out of high-strength steel, not concrete (which needs steel in it anyway) @austinhwade nice don’t doubt ur vibe now on spotify  https://t.co/yylgnf4d7q  https://t.co/lovc2ryn72 @vincent13031925 i appreciate the kind words!

@picklepunchd @erdayastronaut needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who don’t have money @ecoheliguy @erdayastronaut yeah. a lot of work is needed for propellant production on mars. @pranshuagarwa13 @erdayastronaut yes @erdayastronaut that’s the goal @erdayastronaut building 100 starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per earth-mars orbital sync @erdayastronaut starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary @fighteer1 @lcs_big_mike @sciguyspace that’s about right @g33st111 reaction to cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to september @spexcast @sciguyspace what’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. starship can travel by itself from surface of mars to surface of earth, but requires massive booster on earth with orbital refilling to get to mars, which is ~38% of earth gravity. @spexcast @sciguyspace densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed @sciguyspace fundamental issue with sls is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy. @sciguyspace densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. much easier with ch4, which is an underappreciated advantage. cooling o2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at n2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% n2. entire system wants to drip air!

[shakes fist at sky] @johnnacrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany yeah, boring bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting vegas convention center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. i ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products! @vincent13031925 @boringcompany certainly worth trying! the objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. if we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever. @jonattenborough @cfidd absolutely. multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. we just need more of them. @ollie_turrell @cfidd pretty much @snipergen @tesla sure. trax will get much better &amp; more fun. this is an alpha version. @cfidd no, i said we should build more tunnels. put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. if you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is. @rationaletienne @evafoxu @amargosavalley that might have something to do with it. “stalin: court of the red tsar” was one of the few books so dark i had to stop reading. if only they’d listened to lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted. @evafoxu @amargosavalley for sure, but i understand the pulse of twitter pretty well. a sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net. @amargosavalley thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. interesting. @toscamusk @kimbal ❤️ you too sis @smzgallagher @tesla sorry about this. we will do our best. the tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard. @johnnacrider1 @mayemusk literally. it was at 40th &amp; baltimore in philadelphia before gentrification. @janeidyeve @johnkrausphotos @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @joe__wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo ramones &amp; bach @johnkrausphotos @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @joe__wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo i hope someone has pics! my mom came to visit one weekend &amp; was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check &amp; guarded the cash with a kitchen knife 🤣🤣 @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @joe__wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo to pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures. @kimbal 🖤 you too @catmonocle69 sounds like a marxist with style @flcnhvy @cyrusposting exactly @cyrusposting induced demand is one of the most irrational theories i’ve ever heard. correlation is not causation. if the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. i support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone. @joe__wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo this is a pretty awful lie. i left south africa by myself when i was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. worked on my mom’s cousin’s farm in saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in vancouver. went to queens univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to upenn/wharton &amp; stanford. @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo this person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. whats their deal? @irinaantony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo we started zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built pc, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from greg kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  my dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway. @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_mikemo he didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; i worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. i couldn’t even afford a 2nd pc at zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. where is this bs coming from? @geofficient pretty much @annerajb @justpaulinelol federal @justpaulinelol @annerajb probably 2021. depends on regulatory approvals. @annerajb hopefully working in caribbean by end of 2020. def by 2021. @waitbutwhy @kurz_gesagt maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. for “close” stars, a laser sail is good too. @theassassin_95 yes, but it’s too secret @erdayastronaut @teslaownerssv @benioff hopefully fully operational in 2020 @teslaownerssv @benioff boring co is completing its first commercial tunnel in vegas, going from convention center to strip, then will work on other projects @flcnhvy no, he’s still much faster 🐌 these would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. really, just an underground road, but limited to evs (from all auto companies). this is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them. @teslaownerssv done by dawn @salo4201 that would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣 build super safe, earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic @janeidyeve flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away @janeidyeve we’re now building flight design of starship sn1, but each sn will have at least minor improvements, at least through sn20 or so of starship v1.0. was up all night with spacex team working on starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). dawn arrives …  https://t.co/szydsyuyou @discovermag please stop spamming bleak links into a paywall @gutgutm3 @jamescharles ok @teslarati activating engine two … @kakarotto1385 @flcnhvy @sofiaan @erdayastronaut it is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers @flcnhvy @sofiaan @erdayastronaut the overarching goal of tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve @flcnhvy @sofiaan @erdayastronaut it’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. there are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware. @kristennetten future feature turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. no input required at all. @sofiaan @erdayastronaut possible, but one step at a time. anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. for example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases! @jeremygreenlee @mobiledavidd seeing b pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. we can enable access to these views. also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home. @mobiledavidd we’re building out superchargers as fast as possible! need to ramp v3 supercharger production. @erdayastronaut phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth. @erdayastronaut most people still don’t know it’s there just swipe down on tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar @teslatino @teslaownerssv @tesla_unplugged @teslaownersofma @tesla @disneyplus @bensullins if you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal superchargers along the way. is it not doing this correctly? @teslaownerssv @tesla_unplugged @teslaownersofma @tesla @disneyplus @bensullins merry christmas 🎄🎁😀 hope you’re enjoying latest software update! @jamescharles yer welcome son @teslaownerssv @tesla_unplugged @teslaownersofma @tesla @disneyplus @bensullins car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. if nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled). @jamescharles that is odd. try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. have forwarded this to service. @teslaownerssv @tesla_unplugged @teslaownersofma @tesla @disneyplus @bensullins no @teslaownersofma @tesla @disneyplus @bensullins coming soon @mikeduncan they should double down on insanity of cats. right move. @janeidyeve @renatakonkoly @mikeduncan black mirror @renatakonkoly @mikeduncan parasite @mikeduncan true @adamdanielking needs improvement @erdayastronaut @tesla yes @royalsociety he was awesome. i squared r heating is why room temp superconductors aren’t needed to carry power long distances efficiently. just jack up voltage. stock art  https://t.co/hswnwk68ov whoa … the stock is so high lol @markets 🤣🤣 @annerajb @rationaletienne @aufrana @cleantechnica big communication penalty for remote work, which means the gain in talent that won’t move has to be very high @therealcliffyb @tesla @spacex truth @rationaletienne @aufrana @cleantechnica wow, accurate analysis! @therealcliffyb @tesla good point @mikensbg @flcnhvy ok ☺️ @rationaletienne @renatakonkoly don’t wanna brag but … 🚘💨 was me @nichegamer henry cavill +1 @renatakonkoly also fake soundcloud rapper @reecethesaxman @youfoundalec @ev_stevee @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey write games @youfoundalec @ev_stevee @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey yes @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey regarding 2.x to 3 hardware update, that should happen in earnest in q1. software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then. @ev_stevee @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, i’d love it. the real constraint is finding great software engineers. @flcnhvy @cgpgrey @thirdrowtesla ok sure @ev_stevee @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey sorry for the delay on v2.x! we just couldn’t get it all done in time. @marialauraadr @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey sorry, it’s been a bit of a struggle. software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute issues. hopefully starts rolling out tonight. @cgpgrey my wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. at least it’s obviously not curated! some day, i should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is 🤣🤣 @renatakonkoly yes 🤣♥️ @technologicali started zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into x/paypal, rolled proceeds again into spacex/tesla, but these are all companies where i played fundamental founding role. not right to ask others to put in money if i don’t put in mine. if tesla &amp; spacex go bankrupt, so will i. as it should be. just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. it’s insane! btw, can someone please delete “investor”. i do basically zero investing. pre vfx cut would be $$$$ @newscientist another milestone @rationaletienne @donchogunchev @tesla @karpathy sending you healing vibes … @rationaletienne @cleantechnica that’s certainly our impression, but it’s an old version of tesla software, so effect is limited @cleantechnica “in-house” 🤣🤣 the real reason for looper was to travel back in time &amp; stop a terrible calamity — the premiere of cats! @lukemiler @jon_favreau for sure great show 🐼  https://t.co/12rguhhpgz holiday gift ideas  https://t.co/ubbofvkyai @dealer_of_happy @tesla we’re working on moving more cars to florida. end of year delivery is intense! very proud of tesla team for all their hard work. @risiblevolatile ok @teslaownerssv yes @djavenue ok @flcnhvy @engineers_feed it’s been years @engineers_feed i try so hard with these jokes! @spaceforcedod starfleet begins @erdayastronaut @nasa @boeingspace for sure!🤞 @nasa @boeingspace orbit is hard. best wishes for landing &amp; swift recovery to next mission. @wonderofscience @naturemuseum does it like the smiths?

@ncbirbhan @erdayastronaut yeah, it’s one of my favorite t-shirts! @teslaownerssv we’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. two seater electric atv designed to work with cybertruck will be fun! electric dirt bikes would be cool too. we won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. i was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when i was 17. @kristennetten your twitter comments are great btw! huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to cybertruck. it’s better because of you! ♥️♥️♥️ @kristennetten this may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs @real_john_d @teslarati @tesla_raj there will be no loss of either @flcnhvy @teslarati @tesla_raj that will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width @everman @teslarati @tesla_raj true, more for parking at destination. really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size suv, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages. @teslarati @tesla_raj we can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. will post exact number soon. speed solves everything  https://t.co/dgylfyinxi @joewbowles @billgates he’s def wrong. solar power is a gigawatt per square km! all you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of arizona, texas or utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire usa. this analysis goes through calcs  https://t.co/fi1i452tm6 super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels!  https://t.co/d9yuul7nve @vincent13031925 @vicentes @neiltyson huge admiration &amp; respect for the tesla china team. their talent &amp; drive is amazing! @vicentes @neiltyson for sure @neiltyson if we create a city on mars, earth-mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive launching third flight of this dragon spacecraft to @space_station tomorrow @ragnvaldr1 yes @mrzakes after a while, hydrogen became sentient @tonytassell @urbandirt @naumanbilly bravo, right thing to do! short selling should be illegal. @willne 🔥🔥 people often think they’re breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with co2, h2o &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.) hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement @brandonorselli still can’t believe how hard it was to get  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr! @harrystoltz1 @royalsociety we sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes @royalsociety tesla was almost called faraday, as original holder of tesla motors trademark refused to sell it to us! it’s artificial do you like our owl?

ok sure. @vicentes hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level @vicentes haha true! new manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then i’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count. ⚔️ study the blade!! ⚔️  https://t.co/cvuw1tmcji @annerajb @flcnhvy we’re creating this alloy at tesla. not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods. @flcnhvy starship steel decision came first. we were going to use titanium skins for cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30x stainless is much stronger. even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made reason cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30x steel, because it breaks the stamping press excellent review by marques! 187k @somepitch yes @revitalize haha v true with no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement 146k cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor @cleantechnica great analysis @generationpls @pewdiepie that would be cool @pewdiepie gonna have some sick attachments @cleantechnica 🤣🤣 @carkuwu armored personnel carrier (apc) riding in the cybertruck @supersaf @tesla sure franz throws steel ball at cybertruck window right before launch. guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.  https://t.co/eb0o4tlpoz 🖤🖤🖤 syd mead 🖤🖤🖤  https://t.co/8nbd5lraqj @reecethesaxman we threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didn’t even scratch the glass! better truck than an f-150, faster than a porsche 911. order cybertruck online at  https://t.co/hltt8dg2no @mithunoorath @tesla yes @jrussell614 will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. would love this to be self-powered. adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. avg miles per day in us is 30. @moesargi tesla 2 person electric atv will come at first as an option for cybertruck @cyberpunkgame see ya in 2077 😉 nobody *expects* the cybertruck  https://t.co/khhynfavks @qrypton yup @tesla_addicted @dmc_ryan haha @dmc_ryan high time we had a tesla coil! cybertruck design influenced partly by the spy who loved me  https://t.co/hkbzxfnfzm @elenmatvievska @tesla coming soon! we’re working to complete the full supercharger route from london to shanghai. tesla cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of mars @ward069 of course @willfealey @tesla fun party guaranteed! long journey tonight @erdayastronaut @spacex absolutely, but to move to mk3 design. this had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different. @mkbhd maybe won’t need a key at all @teslatested so many reporters gave chanos airtime when he called tesla a worthless fraud. now that he has been proven wrong, silence … @lexfridman @nsf gravitas is overrated  https://t.co/4mdtebfejy @supazt @erdayastronaut that would be cool national science foundation, u should add a w to ur name. would get way more clicks. ur welcome.  https://t.co/lvcnlztkpa 78% of people want to gentrify mordor @slashdot the china space industry is very impressive @mrclipsmaniac cephalopods have a strange intelligence @justpaulinelol @universal_sci it certainly does @universal_sci true @teslaownerssv @teslarati not sure. maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?

@teslaownerssv @flcnhvy so it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to mars base alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable @teslaownerssv @flcnhvy as the planets align only once every two years @teslaownerssv @flcnhvy a thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable mars city @malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy no problem. we could program starship to perform swan lake in the sky. minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard. @flcnhvy current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which falcon is about half @flcnhvy if we build as many starships as falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year @flcnhvy payload to orbit per year of starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3x per day, which is ~1000x per year @flcnhvy the economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on mars @cleantechnica gas/diesel cars too @cleantechnica true extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy)  https://t.co/ecacsaqaxr @simonegiertz of course! @bensullins yes the date is strangely familiar …  https://t.co/yzl5r1pojl cybertruck unveil on nov 21 in la near spacex rocket factory @uhaveanygrapes @teslarati looking into it @ryanth3nerd @teslarati yes @fredericlambert @teslarati the audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the af @justpaulinelol @teslarati naturally @teslarati this is based on an incorrect electrek article. the air force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “pitch day” &amp; i happened to mention cybertruck. they don’t buy apcs. it’s the air force. @willfealey @teslarati fair point. coming soon. we’re making foundational upgrades to the core tesla corporate os. 2fa right after that. @teslarati connected, autonomous cars require great software. advanced factories also require great software. the car industry is not very good at software. @cleantechnica more to come @bob_burrough yes @rafaelcr @ofwudan would be odd to expect anything else @tj_cooney that said, most starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on earth @tj_cooney wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! with fairing recovery, falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. no boats needed. @flcnhvy great poem great work by spacex dragon team &amp; airborne! to be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. @teslarati putting model s in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. show should be called “low gear”! tesla solarglass vs 🎃  happy halloween!!  https://t.co/p5txejyqne @stephenpallotta @teslarati sorry, drag times is correct, top gear is wrong @teslarati drag race times analysis is correct. also, there’s a software upgrade for model s coming out that increases peak power by 50hp, so model s should beat porsche taycan turbo s by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races. @teslany walking on a tesla solarglass roof is definitely no problem! thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar! @tobi @chris__lu @markrober @mrbeastyt congrats! shopify is great btw. nice work. @flcnhvy the fires are all too real @nutaiie haha true @teslastars @tesla … ♥️ snacks ♥️  https://t.co/lpczyx607f @johnkrausphotos @nasa @space_station hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess soon, spacex will launch @nasa astronauts to @space_station! @themuskbros @teslaownerssv that’s significantly improved in current production @renatakonkoly @mrbeastyt @mkbhd true, my name literally means tree @teslaownerssv if you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you’re home &amp;

melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs. @realdiegomonroy i hate advertising unfortunately, it’s hard to google tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; seo. go to  https://t.co/uvqa8joe7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp;  https://t.co/d9yuul7nve for a new roof with integrated solar. we don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot if you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, tesla is reducing solar+powerwall prices by $1000 as of today apologies to those waiting for solar/powerwall outside california, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires @jasondunn so true. imagine if phones were gasoline powered. total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future! homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to zillow. adding a powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important.   https://t.co/3y4m5l50qf @flcnhvy @teslaownerssv i’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs @starshipsara extremely high @teslaownerssv will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters us clean energy incentive drops by 4% on jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly nov 15 to be installed in time tesla solar plus powerwall battery backup for 24/7 clean energy &amp;

building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at tesla or spacex. we’re gonna take this to a whole new level! @erdayastronaut tesla team has done an incredible job with giga shanghai. honored to work with them. i’m in awe. so much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. it’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. my hat is off to you … @rationaletienne @laurenrow5 @evafoxu @johnnacrider1 @kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @sofiaan @hamids @insideevs tesla is first american car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. hardest, most painful thing i’ve ever been through, including getting falcon to orbit. @rationaletienne @laurenrow5 @evafoxu @johnnacrider1 @kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @sofiaan @hamids @insideevs prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard and the lead character is also named woody  https://t.co/zxk84rb020 @notericralph @martiandays @erdayastronaut @torybruno @aerojetrdyne yeah, gimbal sl engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines @ttownjoe @erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne conservation of energy tells you the answer @ingvar_oolsen @neiltyson @space_station looking forward to kerbal 2! @martiandays @erdayastronaut @torybruno @aerojetrdyne we def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower. @nextspaceflight @erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire raptor vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table @nextspaceflight @erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne couple months, but v1.0 of raptor vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. isp maybe 365 to 370 sec. @erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne max thrust version of raptor should achieve true t/w &gt; 170. target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-f. max isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but t/w probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. these are just guesses for now. @erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne oberth effect is not well appreciated. value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. one of the reasons we favor ch4 over h2.  https://t.co/lijrumujdq @torybruno @erdayastronaut @martiandays @aerojetrdyne this is true. all that matters is number used in ∆v equation. propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  https://t.co/s2lceapgau @harrystoltz1 @neiltyson @space_station big challenge for starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters. @teslaownerssv @sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted we’re working on a simple initial version of autopark. will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces. @sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted yeah, great team! @j_ump_er @neiltyson @space_station to be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. center of mass of earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at space station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of earth.  https://t.co/21hicwczmq @harrystoltz1 @neiltyson @space_station exactly. and you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere. @neiltyson @space_station most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. a spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space. @nasaspaceflight @ianpineapple yeah, will be raptor vertical test stand. hopefully allows simplification of raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. also, more representive of flight. test as you fly … @annerajb @tesla_addicted software @stevemartineau6 @annerajb @yogisc1127 @tesla yes @tesla_addicted will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon @flcnhvy @aquastorm venus would be very difficult @tesla_truth @annerajb @yogisc1127 @tesla true @aquastorm yes, we will @annerajb @yogisc1127 @tesla it is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at tesla. takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp;

much better than driving a single car. @tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. energy loss is fairly minor. just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude. @wilsonlam 😉 @annerajb @thebault_arthur working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more fsd features being released. @thebault_arthur still working with rdw, the car regulatory authority in netherlands. unclear why there’s a delay. other countries are supportive. now that tesla v10.0 with smart summon is out, full self-driving price will increase by $1000 on nov 1 get tesla solar plus powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp;

doing an amazing job! honored to work beside them. @justpaulinelol @keithmansfield @erdayastronaut if 20km works, then orbit @keithmansfield @erdayastronaut great summary of the key points! @oranmaliphant @erdayastronaut @angelndevil2 @markchica @futurejurvetson @bluemoondance74 @spacex that’s about right, except no sensors. tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced. @angelndevil2 @markchica @futurejurvetson @bluemoondance74 @spacex it’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe @angelndevil2 @markchica @futurejurvetson @bluemoondance74 @spacex raptor cost is tracking to well under $1m for v1.0. goal is &lt;$250k for v2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton @johnnacrider1 @rationaletienne @laurenrow5 @renatakonkoly @kristennetten @evafoxu @memesofmars @positivepyrami1 stop sending me this 💩 🤣🤣 @rationaletienne @laurenrow5 @evafoxu @kristennetten @stevehamel16 @theelonmasked @memesofmars @michellbasler @mayemusk @kimbal agreed &amp; such a heartwarming photo ♥️ @kristennetten @ss4adrian i have that exact thought every time i get the flu @ss4adrian clearly a sign of the apocalypse! @engineers_feed lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts. @engineers_feed thankfully not. fsw is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel. production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see @colinpearceuk bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back @trevormahlmann haha yes @harrystoltz1 in solving for a good mars climate, we will learn a great deal about how to do so on earth. it is the inverse problem. inside starship cargo bay. header tanks mounted in tip of nosecone to offset engine weight at rear.  https://t.co/ejswqmcooa @evafoxu @disruptresearch @tesla @karpathy cool video! @disruptresearch @tesla @karpathy probably our most viral feature ever. most of the autopilot team has been working on this, led by ashok, cj, andrej &amp;

machining of raptor — far more than in design of the engine itself! @erdayastronaut @cor_space there’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places @carter__99 @erdayastronaut @askingbubble385 @cor_space yes @erdayastronaut @cor_space well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. however, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what i find remarkable about it. @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @cor_space no, we’ve been focusing on production (now on sn12). only need 250 bar or even a bit less for starship/super heavy. anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight. @ncbirbhan @erdayastronaut @cor_space probably around 6 or 7pm @erdayastronaut @cor_space what blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12,000 psi @garythebot_ figure of speech meanwhile, back in reality @dloesch media report was false @erdayastronaut @cor_space raptor uses milled copper channels with an inconel jacket all the way down three raptors on a starship  https://t.co/urrid62evk @evafoxu @brendancogbill7 always @spacepadreisle @spacex wow, it’s been 5 years since we started at boca! @brendancogbill7 about a week. will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback. @justpaulinelol we look for rare corner case issues with a limited release us build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. so, soon, but hard to say exactly. @garythebot_ gary, you rock! tesla v10.0 just started rolling out to all us tesla owners with fsd option &amp; “advanced download” selected in vehicle software settings @moyo5150 more like  https://t.co/f8bulz0xdo anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. if they’re evolving rapidly, something’s up. if advanced ai (beyond basic bots) hasn’t been applied to manipulate social media, it won’t be long before it is @wally_wests exactly @kristennetten @annerajb @jennerator211 @erdayastronaut that would be a nice touch @flcnhvy @28delayslater @djsnm this is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so @28delayslater @djsnm haha awesome @markchica @kristennetten @teslagong @teslaownerssv @teslatunity @tesla we could probably do that @erdayastronaut 50m @teslagong @teslaownerssv @teslatunity @tesla not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user’s discretion @annerajb @jennerator211 @erdayastronaut with rare exceptions, composites would make starship heavier. they don’t stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great. @jennerator211 @erdayastronaut mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry &amp; 1400 tons wet, but aiming for 120 by mk4 or mk5. total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons. @teslaownerssv @teslatunity @tesla absolutely @teslatunity @tesla you’re welcome! feature requests always appreciated. @erdayastronaut @kimitalvitie six. two windward, one under each fin &amp;

sql @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @tesla it would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-tesla battery! @teslarati this includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization. @teslarati tesla is building a major engineering team in china, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car @the_shadowzone @djsnm for sure more than one pass coming back to earth. to mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise. @oranmaliphant @erdayastronaut could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust @erdayastronaut better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let t^4 be your friend. lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing. @djsnm exactly. for reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. for ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. therefore reusable like starship wants lift during high mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat. @erdayastronaut it does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. more about this on the 28th. @erdayastronaut that’s correct. essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver. @bopinion herbert diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. the good of the world should come first. for what it’s worth, he has my support. @janeidyeve just sent a note to check some secrets are too dangerous to be free  https://t.co/g547udmij7 @theonion “between the trees and the forest floor, it’s like a giant mural,” continued the veritable high priest of the harvest season, adding that he would soon have to rake his driveway, an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere scarf. @mich41v4294 @flcnhvy @28delayslater @karpathy hoping to open in slovakia, croatia, serbia &amp;

a skydiver. @happych19952208 😉 @cptncrutch5373 @erdayastronaut @kalzsom approximately correct. we also fire the acs thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn. @kalzsom @erdayastronaut for aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure. @erdayastronaut current analysis, which i’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for mk1/mk2 @erdayastronaut stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as acs thrusters. the smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg. @erdayastronaut stability is not an issue with 3 @spacexfan97 nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. placed up there to balance high mass of raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom. @spacexfan97 yes. there’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out. adding the rear moving fins to starship mk1 in boca chica, texas  https://t.co/hwlihqihph @teslaownerssv thanks! either way, sustainable energy wins!! @cleantechnica srsly @vincent13031925 @residentsponge @teslarati it’s my 🔥 glasses 😉 @robotbeat @justpaulinelol @teslarati sure. have to do it on mars from beginning. will ultimately do that on earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term. @teslatested @teslarati next quarter @teslatested @teslarati will discuss with my product team next week, but probably @justpaulinelol @teslarati yes @teslarati great work by spacex parachute engineering! the crew dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. the apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem! @tdenton1138 @sciam @gretathunberg a 16 year old who has better reasoning &amp;

one gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in nevada. giga shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater china area. over time, regional gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide. @teslaownerssv @kristennetten @model3owners should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg uk &amp; ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. the intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win. @teslaownerssv @kristennetten @model3owners that’s not to say that tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why i’m looking into it @teslaownerssv @kristennetten @model3owners at end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (earth is a big place). small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances. @kristennetten @model3owners the fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. this is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world. @flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @teslatunity @model3owners agreed @hoofhrtd1254 @teslatunity @model3owners going to early access (including all who bought fsd) tesla owners in us next week. if us early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. might be some delays in eu for regulatory approval. @teslatunity @model3owners there aren’t really meant to be “tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. overarching principle, however, is same deal for all. @model3owners looking into this. a fundamental premise of tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining. @justpaulinelol @31wa hopefully, next year @slashdot personally, i think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8 @wonderofscience sagan was awesome @wikipedia they used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your … along the thames river in london  https://t.co/p8sjgokly8 @31wa haha exactly! @kristennetten yes @garythebot_ yes, that’s exactly what i meant, gary the bot! tesla commercial solar ordering now live at  https://t.co/sckn87vma9! @rationaletienne @guardian @verge @cnbc @qz @reuters @nytimes @jalopnik @newyorker @business at least they had great cigars 👍  https://t.co/iqb25ratbv @teslarati ahem  https://t.co/amltcvshgz @justpaulinelol @dc_nawfel @universal_sci a speedraptor is a velociraptor with no sense of direction (that’s how you can them apart) @justpaulinelol @dc_nawfel @universal_sci this is technically a speedraptor @teslarati autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting better, as we examine every crash for improvement &amp;

can be adjusted/improved real-time. essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun). @wingod @djsnm @thephoenixflare true, diverting a comet would be super hard. could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky. nuke mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. much like our sun, this would not cause mars to become radioactive. @janeidyeve will probably make sense to do this when starship mk 1 has 3 raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid september @harrystoltz1 @thephoenixflare will be converted to raptor vertical test stand @thephoenixflare trickier than it may seem on mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming @eatinggaming94 @4thfromourstar 🤣🤣 might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm mars vs artificial suns (tbd) @sciguyspace @hover389 af certification required an enormous amount of work. it’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based. @memesofmars @teslarati @ray4tesla yeah, would be great to get feedback from tesla supporters @teslaownerssv @teslarati initially model 3, later y @teslarati looking forward to seeing giga shanghai soon 😀 amazing work by tesla china team &amp; support of authorities much appreciated! @flcnhvy @sciguyspace not yet @sciguyspace this is a great idea @royalsociety 🤣🤣 @jalanishreyansh um i ate most of it cookie decorating contest with kids  https://t.co/tp06cr4af5 converts about 5 million tons of mass to energy every second great name! wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit earth eventually &amp; we currently have no defense. @justpaulinelol don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible one click to order solar &amp; save ~$500/year in utility bills with no long-term contract (cancel anytime) @flcnhvy next year with the new lower tesla pricing, it’s like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious. tesla solar just relaunched. lmk what you think …  https://t.co/mdopo17yb9 which means a small corner of texas  (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire united states 1 gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches earth’s surface @flcnhvy @worldandscience in a few years @worldandscience yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons &amp; abdomen is the accumulator generates a *lot* of energy  https://t.co/k5nuwfb8im @jasonemry it is quite silly @nadavision meaning less than a century. but this would be pretty intense. @nadavision aspirationally, decades the sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi @epic2662 yes not saying it solves everything, mind you, but it’s a step in the right direction @itsjoshpeck yeah, the trick is opening &amp;

immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. even though i’m immersed in starship/raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real. @ajtourville @marstronauts @erdayastronaut approx min payload to mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100b @tesla powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both tesla &amp;

he often has interesting things to say @janeidyeve @teslarati no sooner than a week. working approvals with faa. @teslarati wouldn’t read too much into this. likely to be fewer f9/fh flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in starship flights. thanks george! @brunosilva @vincent13031925 @residentsponge @teslarati @tesla we’re working with eu regulators to improve rules. spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. navigate on autopilot working well in rest of world. @cleantechnica but actual road data is what matters most  https://t.co/q44lsjjzza @harrystoltz1 @sofiaan @iihs_autosafety @atj721 ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident. @harrystoltz1 @sofiaan @iihs_autosafety @atj721 good question. nhtsa is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. ncap also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. super inside baseball stuff … @sofiaan @iihs_autosafety @atj721 well said! @bluemoondance74 @erdayastronaut ok 🎶 strangers in the night 🎶  https://t.co/9zureljxjq @erdayastronaut sure rocket fairing falling from space (higher res)  https://t.co/sa1j10qawi and @jayleno really knows cars!  https://t.co/qn3x0uzp4v rocket fairing falls from space &amp;

we won’t be able to. @flcnhvy @snazzyq @phenomenalpoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech no, since tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers @snazzyq @phenomenalpoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech if we make all cars with fsd package self-driving, as planned, any such tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week @snazzyq @tailosivetech basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. team convinced me better to go with pearl white. presentation streaming live from  https://t.co/nrsygnf65k at 8pm pacific @dimas_______ @antonioregalado @neuralink streaming. check neuralink website later today. starts around 8pm. @clarab_kgbt @spacex @kgbt won’t be today, hopefully tomorrow @antonioregalado @neuralink sure, will do @antonioregalado this guy is not a cofounder of neuralink. was at company briefly, but he didn’t work out. @teslamotorsclub !! @alvin_vista @amaudes @pedrocosilva we are tiny, simple creatures @nichegamer rip @stasvladimirsky @jhc2718 @stephanieeeeej um … yes graham’s number  https://t.co/qgqafeiqdz to infinity and beyond!  https://t.co/dgystbqwfv @memesofmars @kristennetten @annerajb @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @patricklac007 @angelgponce @tesla spacex thruster package will be subtle. hidden behind license plate. @annerajb @kristennetten @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @patricklac007 @angelgponce @tesla haha yes @pbreit @patricklac007 @angelgponce @tesla yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. those are very hard even for careful human drivers. @kristennetten @annerajb @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @patricklac007 @angelgponce @tesla yeah, that’s next after summon @annerajb @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @patricklac007 @angelgponce @tesla will trace back inertial measurements &amp;

starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail. @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @mattlbates @erdayastronaut you’re touching on a good critique of falcon 9. our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. we’re fixing that with starship. @baconmashwbs @canis_majoris_6 @yusifzadaagshin that would be unwise. probably needs a restraint mechanism like disney’s space mountain roller coaster. would feel similar to space mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent. @canis_majoris_6 @yusifzadaagshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. it’s basically an icbm traveling at mach 25 that lands. @yusifzadaagshin about 100, assuming people want cabins. pressurized volume is similar to a380. could take a lot more on shorter trips. @erdayastronaut @sciguyspace that was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low @c3lt_games @sciguyspace there will be no block 6. moving to starship architecture. @ebelliveau @sciguyspace frangible would def hurt reusability. also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible. @sciguyspace good to see this. splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work. @cocalarix @romaarra probably sooner @romaarra ok @therrinkscvc @steelsully @annerajb @kickber @explorespaceksc sure, that would be an honor @erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mattlbates most likely. it is programmed to do so. @justpaulinelol @mattlbates @erdayastronaut high entry force &amp;

fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. swear these are legit technical terms 🤗 @some1gee @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy it’s a factor. main reason is that ffsc is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity. @elthiryel @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue merlin turbine blades. solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to raptor. @spacexfan97 @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. coking not really an issue. @engadget so cool @soswow @elontimes anything with high contrast @teslaownerssv @elontimes excessive shades of grey @elontimes yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. concrete seams too. so glamorous. @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps. @28delayslater @evafoxu third revision of enhanced summon hopefully going to tesla owners with early access later this week @evafoxu haha @joe_mckirdy @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy depends on destination @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy planning on a simplifying mod to raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mt level @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy since raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. however, raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1. @datklow chomsky sucks yet another monty python reference, possibly my favorite  https://t.co/kzjh26eien anarcho-syndicalism ftw!! @erdayastronaut @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy more than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven @harrystoltz1 @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year. @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. production is ramping exponentially, though. sn6 almost done. aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year. @minamyoussef @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy  https://t.co/nehmzhyjee @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy for sure moon 1st, as it’s only 3 days away &amp;

🛰 details @bloodsportcap @teslarati china ev subsidies mostly end this month &amp; fully end in about 7 months @izackton12 yes @willfealey no problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. it’s great to get thoughtful criticism. @benedictevans @parthsheth 155mph is common on the autobahn. even with only 5 offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to 31mph. @uzakbaydaniyar tesla superchargers &amp; service centers coming to kazakhstan this year @fredericlambert @benedictevans @parthsheth yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings @benedictevans @parthsheth avg speed of ny subway is actually 17mph. tbc loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. that’s 57,600/hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience. @teslarati only cars made in china are eligible for these subsidies. tesla has never had access to them. @cleantechnica exactly @vincent13031925 @tesla we’re trying to simplify product complexity, so only offering white (technically black &amp;

ease of operations. distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly mach 20. @ppathole @erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @spacexnow @chrisg_nsf @nasaspaceflight add 2 to 4 more raptors for starship point to point on earth. you can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. this was an unexpected result. @kimitalvitie @erdayastronaut @spacexnow @chrisg_nsf @nasaspaceflight wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). doesn’t affect schedule much though. @kimitalvitie @erdayastronaut @spacexnow @chrisg_nsf @nasaspaceflight not bad @erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @spacexnow @chrisg_nsf @nasaspaceflight exactly. we’re on the wrong planet for ssto. no problem on mars or any of the moons. @teslatunity @everman @andykiersz yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against tesla has reached new heights @everman @andykiersz i paid most of my tesla-related expenses too. tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me. @dealer_of_happy @tesla one day’s grace, taking into account time zone confusion. will revert tomorrow. @nichegamer edgy move @spexcast @wentaiw @1darknesssoul5 @spacex good idea @wentaiw @1darknesssoul5 @spacex true. i’m a gamer &amp; my boys are too. starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games. @cleantechnica yup @fcain @varunversion1 @erdayastronaut @spacex would love to do exactly that @cosmic_penguin agreed, sent a note to starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. we’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun. @fcain @varunversion1 @erdayastronaut @spacex exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. that said, we’ll make sure starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. we care a great deal about science. @john_gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @erdayastronaut @spacex rotate on one axis. magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels. @goforstaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @erdayastronaut @spacex yes, already planned. we avoid use of certain lower ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy. @1darknesssoul5 @spacex aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @erdayastronaut @spacex if we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. most orbital objects are close to earth btw, as shown by this nasa density map.  https://t.co/83mwizaep6  https://t.co/nllmxregrg @varunversion1 @erdayastronaut @spacex there are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. we need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. atmospheric attenuation is terrible.  https://t.co/ouwyfnmw0d @erdayastronaut @spacex no, raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency. @meme0boi fair @erdayastronaut @spacex super proud of spacex propulsion/test/materials team! one of hardest technology problems. new high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace. @djsnm only a tiny amount. there is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering. @spexcast @erdayastronaut @spacex propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of mars. @erdayastronaut @spacex great video. couple notes: raptor designed for subcooled ch4/o2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. merlin thrust/weight doubled from v1, but raptor is closer to optimum. @teslaownerssv @tesla whoa cool 😀 @john_gardi @marco_langbroek @spacex yes beautiful solar sail @mcjamez @_jameshatfield_ @danielcincu @alex_parker iss is extremely gigantic &amp;

upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value. @marialauraadr it’s not my finest work 🤣 @m_xalher @tesla @valueanalyst1 given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. consumers are starting to realize this. 💨 &amp; 🌌  https://t.co/wwl7neh98w @marcushousegame @spacex 👍 @spacex krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every 90 mins @steveieb21 no @mike_calhoun @phenomenalpoto 🤣🤣 absolutely @teslatn yes, 3 to 6 months @alharding @ex_tesla @el_timbo @heikki_anttila lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected thus *reducing* existing road traffic another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot @quayran opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below @flcnhvy @dmc_ryan yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn’t matter @djsnm @martijn_schuman @erdayastronaut @spacex @fcain exactly. still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed! @dmc_ryan paperwork &amp;

thousands of deaths, but one tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. why the double standard? this is a real question. those who predicted tesla &amp; evs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. why the double standard? almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp;

wsj in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil @grzf_ starship is kinda gundam @knightmararchon @evbite @johnrobb very much so. there are 2.5b cars &amp; trucks on earth. even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25m vehicles per year. tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25m or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply. @teslarati sentry mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. even tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner. @nichegamer @ncbirbhan @cbsnews mint berry crunch @teslarati poetic justice @ncbirbhan @cbsnews boring candy coming soon … @cbsnews mr buffett, please stop destroying dairy queen. in the name of all that is holy, please stop. @tsrandall wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! if you have peak capacity of x, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than x. first 6-12 months, it will be much less than x. impossible to predict exact production ramp s-curve. @tsrandall there is 35 gwh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. it was physically impossible to make more model 3’s in q1 due to cell constraints. @calinroman3 @gregmatson yes @gregmatson yes, all cars with autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of tesla cars built to date @erdayastronaut @kneibert your interventions do train the nn, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability @fredericlambert yes @yaypie there will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase @rebel44cz hopefully have the order page live before then. if not, will push price change out a bit later. @brandonbernicky @tsrandall not good enough yet. pushing release by a few weeks. will be amazing. @tsrandall incorrect. pana cell lines at giga are only at ~24gwh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on model 3 output since july. no choice but to use other suppliers for powerwall/powerpack cells. tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35gwh theoretical. @kneibert tesla will start fsd computer upgrade in a few months @frozencanuck something like that starting may 1 please note that the price of the tesla full self-driving option will increase substantially over time @jczolko coming this year lease a tesla online in a few mins &amp;

allow below current “0%” level. making that adjustment too. @garagedoorsgman @sherylcrow @tesla agreed @sherylcrow @tesla night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. this is ultimately our fault. we will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions. @sherylcrow @tesla change your screen preference from night mode to auto @martinengwicht @kenklippenstein @mikaelthalen fur-curious @kenklippenstein @mikaelthalen these rumors are untrue! @karlstrahl responsible for more deaths than any other chemical! weirdly, dihydrogen dixoxide, with only one extra oxygen, is not good to drink, but great for changing hair color. @ci_b0rg axel f  https://t.co/djr8kgvilh  https://t.co/hvm0ecooep obv just someone in a 🐿 suit. also, very sus that a 🦊 is reporting on this.  https://t.co/rzyhczarcf dogecoin value may vary  https://t.co/uwerahpv63 dogecoin rulz  https://t.co/flwwugaglu @dogecoin uh oh @tom_heats dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. it’s pretty cool. yup @klod_ua @universal_sci some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant prevalves. hopefully overcome soon. @universal_sci what could possibly go wrong? @trevmckendrick no @iron_mechanic you’re so right. working on it! @vhollywood21 that car seemed so advanced when i watched that show as a kid! ♥️ knight industries two thousand @maxwellk_ @teslarati and even tinier ones for tardigrades @maxwellk_ @teslarati yes 🐜 @teslarati going forward, all tesla stores will be tiny &amp;

fast, so dicey. @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @discovermag annoying that @ula perpetuates myth that delta iv heavy or atlas v can do some orbits that falcon heavy can’t. this is absolutely false. fh would have to go full expendable for geo direct, but that’s very rare. @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @discovermag yeah, falcon heavy block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max q without changing any parts. fh block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying. @erdayastronaut @discovermag probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 raptor vacuum engines. mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with isp of 380. then drop a few dozen modified starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 isp, mr 2. spread out, see what’s there. not impossible. @emilmelar retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the tesla fsd computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. for now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have tesla fsd computer, as our software is more refined for hw2. @macbentosh anyone who bought fsd will get it anyone who purchased full self-driving will get fsd computer upgrade for free. this is the only change between autopilot hw2.5 &amp; hw3. going forward “hw3” will just be called fsd computer, which is accurate. no change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. this is v important. @nextspaceflight @erdayastronaut @discovermag yes. sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. great work by spacex dragon engineering team. major improvement over dragon 1. @erdayastronaut @discovermag massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. best choice for the impatient. ion engines are too slow. @discovermag we should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. maybe there’s an alien artifact out there … @erinwinick @techreview super cool! @martin_galway good point @ialexryan tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! will investigate. @gerberkawasaki rare use case, but it is possible. there are complications with this. eary prototype roadsters had this ability. @chadymattar exactly @briantu super proud of tesla autopilot team! @_davidmacmillan no, it is one week either way. @jose_goncalves_ 🤗 @erdayastronaut @nasa @vp i think so. for sure worth giving it our best shot! would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo. @nasa @vp it would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon! @ramlover69 12,000 lbs!? how puny. do you construct children’s toys? that’s exactly it. you’re no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day. @zachary1978 @tesla good point hard to appreciate how much tesla autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it @skiddlybinx yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.  yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads. @thejimos glad you like it! navigate on autopilot hopefully approved for europe soon. thank you! @rstefani11 will do @icannot_enough @andrewmackenzie ford has 4 ceos in 5 years &amp; nobody blinks, but tesla loses 1 intern &amp; it’s front page news. i tell ya (shakes fist at sky) … @worldandscience it’s possible to make a self-sustaining city on mars by 2050, if we start in 5 years &amp; take 10 orbital synchronizations @littlemissflint @ryan_deitsch you’re most welcome! glad to be helpful. @uretericbud @tesla only when y is in production @andrewmackenzie every car company is constantly changing prices, but nobody cares @buidlhodl import tariffs, vat &amp;

carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. super heavy booster is stainless steel. since it only goes to around mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint. @some1gg transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  zero refurbishment. @kristennetten no straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps testing starship heatshield hex tiles  https://t.co/pyce9vthxq @mathias_wehler @sloppy93 @erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots @sloppy93 @erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 only some of the hottest sections @annerajb @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 full size @annerajb @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 we decided to skip building a new nosecone for hopper. don’t need it. what you see being built is the orbital starship vehicle. @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 you can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. that has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber. @nextspaceflight @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 working on regulatory approval for both boca chica, texas, and cape kennedy, florida. will also be building starship &amp; super heavy simultaneously in both locations. @the_real_keagan @tesla @liketeslakim @bensullins @teslainventory agreed @erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. we’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed. @omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 started rolling it out a few days ago. always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout … @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 hopefully. always many issues integrating engine &amp;

upgrades aren’t so crazy @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @tesla this causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules. @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @tesla not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production @dave_ross @tesla might arrive by june, but def before end of summer @trevormahlmann @tesla @popmech model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. if we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity. @colinrossubc827 @tesla @popmech exactly! in fact, better to have rwd with winter tires than awd with summer tires. we appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy awd, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions. @tesla @popmech still get this question a lot, even though norway 🇳🇴 has highest tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). also, awd is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice. about a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of tesla cyberpunk truck  https://t.co/hlsgsdyuga end titles from blade runner played after model y webcast cut  https://t.co/wjr1midzph designed to feel much bigger on inside than it looks on outside. an incredibly important principle. @liketeslakim there was something, but no one caught it @geopilot @dimas_______ @liketeslakim it also feels way bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside @shurathi17 would love to be there this year. if not, definitely next! 💛 india 💛 @dimas_______ @liketeslakim yeah  https://t.co/bwvurctxc0 @liketeslakim  https://t.co/j3jyxghwdi @supersaf @tesla exactly! london to beijing supercharger route worth watching revenge of the electric car. covers rebirth of electric cars in general. has footage before &amp;

board. @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @mrtommycampbell @tesla when prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write tesla a check. so it goes. @soundanswer @marc_benton @mrtommycampbell yes @marc_benton @mrtommycampbell those prices will revert to normal on monday too applies worldwide @vincent13031925 yes tesla car prices go up ~3% next week, except for $35k model 3. order online at  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr before then for current prices. @teslaownerssv @jays200 @tesla couldn’t resolve all the rights issues. will add another racing game soon. @jays200 @tesla ok @erdayastronaut @somepitch yeah, it might break @mfrunker @cleantechnica software release later this week should make it better @somepitch 2 @cleantechnica true (sigh) @cleantechnica true @drew78823936 @erdayastronaut @djsnm @rockettenor @nasa @spacex @space_station @commercial_crew probably right. starship rate of progress far exceeds falcon &amp;

other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to spacex’s success. great respect &amp; appreciation! @janeidyeve thank you evelyn, i loved it @alexmd2 @jpuconn @wsj indeed. i have great respect for judges. it’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the us justice system. @jpuconn @wsj sec forgot to read tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. how embarrassing … 🤗 oh hi lol  https://t.co/9wvbtthoxs fate *loves* irony. frankly, too much. meetings are a valuable use of time!  https://t.co/sdckdbp5e5 @internetofshit there’s a 🐜 in my 👟 🤣 @jaybahel  https://t.co/ljjcd7bagx respawn++  https://t.co/mlagk38lkk great meme review hosted by will smith @xkcdcomic haha true @nextspaceflight it’s designed to be way better. we’ll see what reality has to say about that. @nextspaceflight yes, lot of risk @tgmetsfan98 @nextspaceflight guys, i have feelings … 😜 @flcnhvy @rogiermaas @spacex focusing on starship instead @rogiermaas @spacex deorbits &amp; burns up over the pacific @erdayastronaut @canzyd upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of merlin. it will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; dragon abort thrusters. @spacexupdates @canzyd including heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so @nextspaceflight depends on when crew dragon comes back. that’s scheduled for launch next saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big. @canzyd high probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by dragon supersonic abort test. otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for falcon 9. starship will take over before the f9 fleet reaches end of life. @spacexupdates crew dragon high altitude abort test @sivarajkumar237 yes 😀 highest reentry heating to date. burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. fourth relight scheduled for april. @abbygarrettx @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey always liked kestrel. it was the robin hood of engines. @djsnm @danaloni @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. once we have a city on mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight. @gavbrowne @bluemoondance74 @danaloni @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey sn2 has changes that should help @balcsi32 @danaloni @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey to the first part. i doubt we’d create a dyson ring or sphere. @balcsi32 @danaloni @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey yes @bluemoondance74 @danaloni @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey merlins. the max chamber pressure run damaged raptor sn 1 (as expected). a lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with sn 2, which is almost done. @danaloni @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. no need though. we have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun. @kell31213876 @vadim15258417 @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey exactly. super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space. @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey you can see the streaks on the vacuum merlin nozzle in flight videos @djsnm @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion. @benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey essentially, yes. great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on mars. @richpitre_co @katlinegrey we are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done @erdayastronaut @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️high engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage. @sasor098 @adamhugo @waycharmar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey that’s true 😀 merlin 1a was terrible. 1c was ok, 1d good, but block 5 merlin (should probably be called 1e) is something special. took about 15 years to get there. @erdayastronaut @marekcyzio @katlinegrey actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. even if they do zero launches, us govt still gives them that. @geopilot @katlinegrey don’t know @katlinegrey spacex commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. despite massive subsidies to boeing/lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against spacex for several years.  https://t.co/sqaycccjtd @martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey exactly. that’s the critical point for starship/bfr: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100x, humanity will never be a multiplanet species. @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey spacex merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg ssme or rd), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. raptor has better isp, but i’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics. @wonderofscience so true 🤡 john clarke 👌 @macodiseas @katlinegrey not true. limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner @tom_heats @coindesk whoever owns the early btc deserves a nobel prize in delayed gratification @coindesk that said, i still only own 0.25 btc, which a friend sent me several years ago. don’t have any crypto holdings. @katlinegrey i have been chief engineer/designer at spacex from day 1. had i been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but i learned from those mistakes.  https://t.co/3r6zqec30a meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k. @kristenhenry55 won’t be long before they do tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019 4000 tesla cars loading in sf for europe  https://t.co/bodbszo3fr @theonion the gritty truth … did meme review last night with justin roiland from @rickandmorty @demeloj agreed. also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location. @newscientist pics are so clear in space! @engineers_feed that last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like @fredericlambert @georgezachary also, tesla was competing for some of same people as openai &amp; i didn’t agree with some of what openai team wanted to do. add that all up &amp; it was just better to part ways on good terms. @fredericlambert @georgezachary i had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering &amp; manufacturing problems at tesla (especially) &amp; spacex @georgezachary to clarify, i’ve not been involved closely with openai for over a year &amp; don’t have mgmt or board oversight  https://t.co/oa5q8nnsnr spacex foundry casting raptor engine manifold out of inconel  https://t.co/zwlqnwgj0r @dark4181 @tesla it will soon @arcadester @dr_ruiz17 @rxtomas518 @officialjoelf @tesla yes, autopilot max speed is 5mph above speed limit off highway or 90mph on highway  https://t.co/jufeavpkj6 of course i still love you  https://t.co/xnolrkynlc @tesla this is in addition to existing cabin overheat protection, which come on automatically at high temps to ensure any babies or pets in the car are safe @flcnhvy @teslaownerssv @lifebykateb @tesla @itscrippleback yes ♥️ 🎼 @teslaownerssv @lifebykateb @tesla @itscrippleback it will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. we def need to add a “request latest update” feature! @lifebykateb @tesla @itscrippleback updating … @tslatimecapsule @bmwi @audi @cadillac @wsj @28delayslater wow, 2013 cnbc - “tesla model 3 ranked most satisfying car”  https://t.co/shrtodu5dt @fredericlambert true, that headline is not exactly going to win a pulitzer for originality @thehumanwire @insideevs @28delayslater probably a month or two. sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit. @insideevs @28delayslater some sites maintained an almost daily tesla deathwatch 11 years ago, reporting with an awful delight. 4000 days later … tesla model x first suv to receive a perfect crash test rating  https://t.co/51dt8byvzd via @businessinsider bet the other carmakers didn’t see that one coming haha @erdayastronaut @john_gardi @w0lfyxd @robotbeat @spacex yeah, but simpler. needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble. @ntvru хаха офигенно @john_gardi @w0lfyxd @robotbeat @spacex starship &amp; super heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version 1. very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on falcon, even though liquid oxygen is 2/3 vehicle mass &amp; helium weighs basically nothing. @didyoujustbitme @nichegamer luke, i am your farter. @jack @karaswisher thanks jack, twitter rocks! 🤡😎🌪💩🔥🥜💨🍃💫🚀🥰 to air is human @id_aa_carmack agreed @pewdiepie sorry  had a vital mission in norway  now i am back @john_gardi @w0lfyxd @robotbeat @spacex true @astrummining @spexcast @mcmurchie @robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex moon first, mars as soon as the planets align @spexcast @ikrbkv @marinavalova2 @alexmd2 @spacex on my bedside table @ikrbkv @marinavalova2 @alexmd2 @spacex a biography on korolev has center place in my study @spexcast @mcmurchie @robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp;

maybe even below $100k. low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on earth &amp; move to mars if they want. @spacexfan97 @robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex yes @robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex this will sound implausible, but i think there’s a path to build starship / super heavy for less than falcon 9 @13ericralph31 @john_gardi @spacex close @john_gardi @spacex but not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter. @spacexfan97 @alexmd2 @spacex much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. definitely pushing the limit of known physics. @_cgp @spacex propellant was not deep cryo. ch4 &amp; o2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. in theory, raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. however, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of starship/super heavy. @john_gardi @spacex yes, aiming for 380 sec isp with vac nozzle. maybe 382 if we get lucky. @13ericralph31 @spacex i think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners @johnkrausphotos @spacex about 11 secs @alexmd2 @spacex definitely! it’s amazing that the rd-170 &amp; rd-180 engines held the record for so many decades. excellent engineering. raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome russian rd-180. great work by @spacex engine/test team!  https://t.co/yprvo0jhyy @rocketisfine @leo190102 i was simply too sexy for it  https://t.co/vugjlyzvji @leo190102 maybe tomorrow just left zeebrugge, now tilburg, then tesla hq in amsterdam &amp;

20 secs  https://t.co/ju6n683dd5 @erdayastronaut @lytovchenkoserg @john_gardi booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry @lytovchenkoserg @john_gardi @erdayastronaut technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). t^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality! @lytovchenkoserg @john_gardi @erdayastronaut rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200k on base, which uncooled steel can handle. starship is around 1700k for a mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind. @malcolmmarsman @erdayastronaut prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads @erdayastronaut welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. to the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles. @erdayastronaut the super heavy booster is only needed on earth, so think of this as just “starship” &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence super heavy 🔥🖤 spacex engineering 🖤🔥 @octagonroa telekinesis @andreti vaporized some copper @teslaownerssv @strikmichael @jothamkitara sentry mode (and dog mode) roll out next week design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. engine reached 172 mt &amp; 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo. raptor just achieved power level needed for starship &amp; super heavy  https://t.co/ncqnavwc35 @strikmichael sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through zeebrugge first time. cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow. @spacex  https://t.co/so2s0ocm4l @fancypantless we’re doing everything we can to get there. it’s a super hard grind. @notnahuel @snazzyq exactly. both prices are shown right next to each other &amp;

doesn’t even need paint! @spacexfan97 @wonderofscience @treebeard1671 @erdayastronaut @keego73 still up to 31. will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up. @wonderofscience @treebeard1671 @erdayastronaut @keego73 mostly true @erdayastronaut @keego73 cold gas thrusters only. will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. simplifies things considerably. @tritexan @spacex yes initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton). preparing to fire the starship raptor engine at @spacex texas  https://t.co/8jcoi1bg6z @treebeard1671 @erdayastronaut @keego73 yes. it’s very rare to find all three. @erdayastronaut @keego73 to be clear, i’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding @erdayastronaut @keego73 will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like f9 @erdayastronaut @keego73 yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide mach regime &amp; angle of attack @erdayastronaut @keego73 absolutely. you’ve touched on a very important point. the ship must be easy to repair on the moon and mars. @iamshack24 @orthereaboot @toxicpath @librab103 and tesla gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar @skiddlybinx about 10 orbit synch windows, which are every 26 months, so self-sufficiency around 2050 all our patent are belong to you  https://t.co/hpk5r5ums6  https://t.co/t99riofeci our true competition is not the small trickle of non-tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! we created tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp;

fairing was blown over. will take a few weeks to repair. @teslarati 310s stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp @cabsandsurfaces almost ready to roll out. regulators just approved. @teslamodel3fan @tesla since it’s part of safety &amp;

block cooling channels. @thecla6771 coming soon. lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country. @popmech when going to ~1750 kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water @reutersbiz untrue @physicsj roughly 4 to 20 minutes for light to travel from earth to mars @techreview director of cern asked me about boring co building the new lhc tunnel when we were at the @royalsociety. would probably save several billon euros. @deba215 @kzooastro yes blood moon over la tonight  (@kzooastro)  https://t.co/agemmyjss3 @thingswork the @space_station zooms around the world about every 90 mins @raptorjesuss tesla is the safest car according to us govt testing @sparklingdisse1 @kimpaquette @cleantechnica i wish them well. track record in auto startups is tough. thousands of us auto startups, but only ford &amp;

raptor development is being done out of our hq in hawthorne, ca. we are building the starship prototypes locally at our launch site in texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport. @mcannonbrookes haha you’re welcome! hope you’re doing well. @greensjeremy @boringcompany @mcannonbrookes about $15m/km for a two way high speed transit, so probably around $750m plus maybe $50m/station glad you like it @axisenguk @bkin87 @rgvaerialphotos @stevehamel16 yes la is so beautiful after the rain  https://t.co/caxowaxcom spacex dragon from as seen from @space_station viewport  https://t.co/we82irbsmp falcon comes home  https://t.co/vctothsbdn @deltaplan @paulojvn we are not yet offering the mid range model 3 in europe @paulojvn which country? there is a 10% import duty, ~20% vat (us prices don’t include sales tax) and about $2000 in extra shipping cost, but it shouldn’t add up to $25k. view of spacex dragon 1 berthed with @space_station in the last cupola opening. dragon 2 (crew dragon) launching soon. @teslaownerssv ok obv must be more pointy tho it needed to be made real @mjensen007 haha  https://t.co/gtaurpzral starship hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the falcon 9 hopper  https://t.co/5dcrgfqymr @sloppy93 @spacex body/tank diameter is 9m or about 30ft @jothepro10 @spacex should be done with first orbital prototype around june @sandt_tyler yes @somepitch yes @erdayastronaut yes this is for suborbital vtol tests. orbital version is taller, has thicker skins (won’t wrinkle) &amp;

across mexico. @jimjimroger yep @dodo723 yes yes. supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of europe next year. from ireland to kiev, from norway to turkey. most people don’t know that the tesla supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout usa, most of europe, canada and china  https://t.co/zzn9tabq8c @martinmeany we are dramatically increasing tesla superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings @magoo5042 @tesla ok @jp_cautillo wow! @jt_richards @mmelinot @chuckyyyd this is incorrect. vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. brake pads on a tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car. most importantly, every electric car, tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!  if not tesla, please take a look at these other options:  https://t.co/fzvnlgwyga and, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements. there are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example california offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, colorado $4000, etc  https://t.co/lmd3znfr9m reminder to us buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! order online at  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit tesla stores. merry christmas &amp;

orbital payload is gigantic. only need booster on earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. starship alone on moons &amp; mars. @john_gardi @martinengwicht @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight @jeromejaccard @robotbeat @alan1bernard coldformed at cryo @malcolmmarsman @themuddyschmuck @martinengwicht @erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight @jeromejaccard @robotbeat @alan1bernard this test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. super heavy will be full height &amp;

we’re using a different alloy mix. i super ♥️ 300 series stainless! @erdayastronaut @jeromejaccard @robotbeat @alan1bernard while there are some material similarities, starship is very different from the atlas design @erdayastronaut @jeromejaccard @robotbeat @alan1bernard stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. unlike atlas, starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized. @wangmeister if tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, tesla will cover the tax credit difference @alan1bernard coming soon @wangmeister it will be tight, but tesla production should have all mid-range model 3 orders delivered by year end @mikekasprzik @tesla try connecting to wifi tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.  reminder to us buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. order online at  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr or visit stores. @quantumverd @quillettem @pewdiepie only if dawkins joins @quillettem interesting @shedletsky 👌 💛 bajirao mastani 💛  https://t.co/xbmdpiyfop  https://t.co/dzyv6s7tjz anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector @mileung yes @chrinder haha @wwerollins namaste 🙏 @taraustralis needs a warmup @space_station @astroannimal @astro_davids must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the earth every 90 minutes! hope you have a merry christmas! @johnkasich thanks, will consider next year @nichegamer @boringcompany so long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won’t matter for the first few layers tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. no more need to call! @wolfejosh 😴 @itsjoeco @wolfejosh 💨 @wolfejosh 💨 as a thank you to tesla short sellers, we named a 💨 after them haha  https://t.co/5gcgm4rt4w @c7five @jaku 👍 perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in la for ~$10m with v1 (godot). next tunnel will be made with v2 (line-storm). v3 (prufrock), aspirationally 10x better, should be operational next year. for reference:  https://t.co/ls4ehn57mw join our underground movement! @deadstocknyc reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out @vicentes @attack @tesla ok 😀💨 @ecoheliguy @erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @tesla autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. they’re only there if there is a complete system failure. turns will definitely be banked in future. are tunnels safe in an earthquake?  https://t.co/vxcz2hi2qx @robotbeat @michaelknaepen @elschumi @fredericlambert @boringcompany exactly @erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @tesla the guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. costs a few hundred dollars in volume. @mattremp yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. less concrete, more trees. @martinengwicht @realkrauswife probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. latter only for tight spaces. @elschumi @fredericlambert @boringcompany passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; i think they’re right. might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. so long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument. @fredericlambert @boringcompany you’re right. we did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so i didn’t include it. we’re working on one that makes things clear. @realkrauswife pop up, park and walk! @realkrauswife i know that area well. best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd st. if all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy a variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety. next step for @boringcompany loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h). @joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany precisely presentation starting at 8:15 @caspiancey @boringcompany this *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go the demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start @flaneur @boringcompany actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better. all boring loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. at that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city. @alanrrios @boringcompany yes this can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just tesla tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp;

roundabouts in development software. your tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all. if you have a tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try navigate on autopilot. it will blow your mind. automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps. @renatakonkoly @spacex machete!! @danwat1234 it was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. in the end, roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the lotus elise or any other car. major credit to ac propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired tesla roadster. without that, tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later.  https://t.co/nxcgyo9jxx @nichegamer yeah, we wanted to name our company after tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the us, europe &amp; later china. @brandonorselli buying  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr took over a decade, $11m &amp; amazing amount of effort. didn’t like  https://t.co/bsrfmry9gm even when we were only making 🚘. tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the tesla motors name. bought trademark off brad siewert for $75k in late 2004. he’d originally filed for it in 1994. our alternative name was faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. @malcolmmarsman @erdayastronaut @thegledinator @w00ki33 @teslarati both, but demo starship is being built now, whereas super heavy hardware will start getting built in spring @erdayastronaut @thegledinator @w00ki33 @teslarati but cool pics of the demo starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks @erdayastronaut @thegledinator @w00ki33 @teslarati yes @cleantechnica interesting @erdayastronaut @thegledinator @w00ki33 @teslarati fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong @erdayastronaut @thegledinator @w00ki33 @teslarati the new design is metal @erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @teslarati as far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint. boring company product launch on dec 18. more than a tunnel opening. will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators. tracking shot of falcon water landing  https://t.co/6hv2azhljm engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! ships en route to rescue falcon.  https://t.co/o3h8ecggj7 @djsnm pump is single string. some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines. @dragonmaurizio we may use it for an internal spacex mission @markkrieger yes, cutaway was a mistake. we will show all footage, good or bad. grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so falcon landed just out to sea. appears to be undamaged &amp;

launch again. nothing wrong with a little swim. 64 satellites 🛰 on this flight! @jennerator211 @ppathole @johnnacrider1 we’re adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the tesla neural net in coming months @johnnacrider1 exactly. default autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. tesla service then contacts the owner. looking into what happened here. @littlemissflint it is so hard to move in armor! @boringcompany you’re all hired! @littlemissflint yes … no … maybe … none shall pass! @bonnienorman @tomb2192 @carpenter_maas ok @bonnienorman @carpenter_maas good advice @eesny @teslaownerssv @s100dfan applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. easy to do yourself or tesla service can do it. we’re also working on vision-only driving. @nikesharora @tesla glad you’re ok @carpenter_maas perhaps most telling is that norway, which is partly above the arctic circle, has more teslas per capita than any other country on earth. @carpenter_maas as the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. there is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic. @johnkrausphotos incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon @matzagatamd @tesla you got it! @dxk_ @zainraz4 @erdayastronaut @spacex three things, one of which is ch4 @picklepunchd @erdayastronaut @spacex no @zainraz4 @erdayastronaut @spacex no @erdayastronaut @spacex reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. can’t wipe it off. @nichegamer haha @pfierens @liketeslakim prof dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. i’d recommend 10% more soc for convenience. @liketeslakim not worth going below 80% imo. even 90% is still fine. also, no issue going to 5% or lower soc. @manic_marge @spacex true ♥️ ♥️♥️♥️♥️🛸🛸🛸🛸♥️♥️♥️♥️  https://t.co/ex8rpqdc8r @spacexiaunch @techreview @_karenhao both @rainnwilson your tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time  https://t.co/fonhniiv8j @tenser one day @highspeeddoc @boringcompany we’re doing an eir for the greater la tunnel network. thought we might need a n-s test tunnel (hence sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead. @teslaownerssv update soon @natgeo sorry ☺️ boring breakthrough @boringcompany  https://t.co/psflhzadwc @megnsander definitely after safety, our goal is to make a tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car @rocketisfine @racchava @gwestr we tried. nintendo won’t license it to us. @racchava @gwestr that would be cool @gwestr haha kinda true 😀 @arnaoutshady never heard of it super fun software easter eggs coming to all tesla s/3/x cars before the holidays! romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games. @prades_maxime software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month @poeticzay yes @nbcnews this is completely backwards. based on what we’ve learned from the hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under la. won’t need a second test tunnel under sepulveda. cool! actually, if you buy a tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. if you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. trying to incent buying with no test drive. @shell tiny wizard 🧙\\u200d♂️ @yobigbrotha @anandmahindra 7 to 10 years @anandmahindra engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. there is so much to build. @jonkudelka touché but if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work @margrethmpossi varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. pain level increases exponentially above 80. there are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! if getting things done matters to you, then @spacex, @tesla, @boringcompany &amp; @neuralink are the places to be. @nasa @nasainsight congratulations! what an amazing track record of success with mars! @swiftonsecurity 😉😉 @forummp3 1000 liters of pure water costs $1 for those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon @playerunknown ah yes fair point used to live in silicon valley, now i live in silicone valley @zedd not yet 🖤 trouble earth is @worldandscience earth’s crust is only ~1% of earth mass, so technically we should be called lava  https://t.co/lm6doeoq2x @worldandscience earth should be called water. our surface is 71% water. mars land area is roughly equal to earth, as it’s all land. even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, mars will be about 2/3 land. @jessedh @tesla yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting @malcolmmarsman contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield if you don’t want a tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in north america  https://t.co/phhbjch2yi via @cleantechnica signing off for a while happy thanksgiving!! 🚀 starships were meant to fly 🚀  https://t.co/6yclrvzzfq @bevvscott starship tooters @orangejamal @speceye @tesla good one @fredericlambert @speceye @tesla good idea @speceye @tesla coming soon @wiredprairie @tesla shifting resources from sales to service for next several days @model3owners should be next week @annerajb no, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than falcon 9 @mwolman98 later versions will technically, two parts: starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; super heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons) renaming bfr to starship @universal_sci no, we’re just going to accelerate bfr @yobigbrotha yes supercharger v3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster tesla supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets. @scottymeuk @scaleymurrsuit no, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original roadster. still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered. @fredericlambert @frozencanuck @scaleymurrsuit in order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast @tsrandall @frozencanuck @scaleymurrsuit what really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. apart from brief moments, tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output. @frozencanuck @scaleymurrsuit lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. priority list is model y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, roadster. @frozencanuck @scaleymurrsuit ok @scaleymurrsuit maybe interesting to work with daimler/mercedes on an electric sprinter. that’s a great van. we will inquire. @willfealey absolutely agree @willfealey investigating @vincent13031925 @jsteinerman probably mid 2019 @lion_lifer tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery @willfealey not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. parts supply chain to uk should be fixed. lmk if not. @acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @tesla should be possible. please ask service &amp; lmk response. @ajaotj36 no, but perhaps in a few years @stars4a_amy yeah, good idea. we have that state internally, so can push data to phone app. @jsteinerman haha, just like super troopers @willfealey ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile tesla rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed adding functionality to tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps @frameshiftshark yes, no upgrades planned for f9. minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided nasa &amp; usaf are supportive. @frameshiftshark radical change btw, spacex is no longer planning to upgrade falcon 9 second stage for reusability. accelerating bfr instead. new design is very exciting! delightfully counter-intuitive. @annerajb it will alert tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in model 3 for best air quality. air filters are smaller than s/x, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times. congratulations @boringcompany on completing the la/hawthorne tunnel! cutting edge technology!  https://t.co/80wbsqekcq  https://t.co/tqhb9hqrxq boring company just broke through the other side!!   https://t.co/4yxqgppvfz @nichegamer @postmalone missed miku concert sigh listening to better now  https://t.co/vycklwkrta @boristheblade02 @kiwiev china, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp;

trains don’t leave often. @vincent13031925 probably some deliveries in march, but april is more certain @madera_raul yes will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to europe &amp; asia in q1. major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently. @fredericlambert we bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter @victorpoughon probably technically able to do so in about a year. then up to regulators. skipping rail saves over a month for east coast deliveries. all things considered, it’s better to use trucks. single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location. tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure model 3 can be delivered in us by dec 31 if ordered by nov 30  https://t.co/npmpusxnwc @insideevs we will fight big tequila! @garos82 @nichegamer that would be awesome @jimmyzhong_iost @spacex easily accessible energy @nichegamer send me a note! @nichegamer would be fun to add to tesla @mackenzietulip @nextspaceflight @spacex @nasa yes @nextspaceflight @spacex @nasa will try again next month congratulations @spacex team! thanks @nasa, much appreciated. rest in peace, stan lee. the many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever. @_sheateher @malibuwine is he ok? it naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. for example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. @karaswisher scary sign of times to come. it will get worse. @kenlacovara agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (ch4 particularly) makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists i know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. they earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. but their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. which is more credible? @seangvarney that is true &amp; should be applauded. right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term. we know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far … @zandywithaz because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do @jackcydia good, but not hospital grade. s &amp; x were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. not enough room in model 3. if tesla can help people in california wildfire, please let us know. model s &amp; x have hospital grade hepa filters. maybe helpful for transporting people. @tizmagik @teslasupport fair point, will reenable @mihk101 agreed, top priority for autopilot team. being cautious for max safety. please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your tesla. thanks! @exzacklyright @mkbhd @austinnotduncan @tesla cool @tesla with similar track wheels/tires/brakes, model s p100d is faster @erdayastronaut @tesla yes @tesla would like to thank robyn for joining the team. great respect. very much look forward to working together. @erdayastronaut @annerajb no, we’re building a bfr dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in boca chica, texas @erdayastronaut @annerajb won’t land propulsively for those reasons. ultra light heat shield &amp; high mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. i think we have a handle on propulsive landings. @annerajb aiming for orbital flight by june mod to spacex tech tree build: falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-bfr ship but comments are 👌 @benioff @boringcompany la/hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates dec 10. runs parallel to 105 freeway from crenshaw blvd to 405. i think twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. my follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days.  https://t.co/gt8pxlomzn @benioff @boringcompany sure, we can do it zeroth law foundation of psychohistory @thescalex i am not @bri_the_cheesy true 2b or !2b love oumuamua jokes remember the future oh hi guys … lol  https://t.co/tx10i0ecrn @martinengwicht @dathandsomejerk @vincent13031925 @teslarati @panasonic yes, germany has outstanding engineering talent @samsheffer just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp;

south america end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020 @annerajb @vincent13031925 @teslarati @panasonic recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in north america, eastern europe, china &amp; japan by end of next year. we are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases. @vincent13031925 @teslarati @panasonic to clarify further, the long-term goal for tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). this is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible. @vincent13031925 @teslarati @panasonic tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at china giga, as we do today in california &amp; nevada. cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner. @teslarati amazing results by @panasonic at tesla gigafactory nevada! very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. together with pana japan cell plants, tesla/pana partnership is producing ~60% of global ev battery output! @lsutgr @karaswisher @recode @dmc_ryan prob 2 to 3 weeks @veldeth_ @amazlngnature v true @amazlngnature cute @chipdtooth haha bring me the horizon  https://t.co/scqpeofnpg @mikekasprzik aiming for next week @teslamotorsclub ♥️ norway 🇳🇴 @insideevs @tesla #’s r wrong, but 🐻 in 🧠 tesla makes 🚘s 4 overseas &amp;

park. @rarelyserious @tesla cool haha legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. guess i have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities. @fredericlambert good point, might put that one back deleted my tesla titles last week to see what would happen. i’m now the nothing of tesla. seems fine so far. @snazzyq @fredericlambert signing off twitter for a few days ... @snazzyq @fredericlambert don’t worry, we’ll make it right @cgasparino @tesla the foia on this will be solid gold. can’t wait. @model3owners not going up. we will just offer those who ordered bought 3p either $5k back or free lifetime supercharging. @lindowitz @fredericlambert it’s a reasonable criticism. we wanted to make the awesome version of model 3 performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. taking corrective action … @cgasparino @tesla exactly, this is total bs. what part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!? @sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @factsdatatruth @tesla we will enable track mode for all performance cars @fredericlambert it was underpriced. anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free supercharging turned off, we will do that. @rtk86 @sheldonth @factsdatatruth @tesla ok, we will turn off lifetime free supercharging and give you $5k refund @ctgm @fredericlambert yeah, or free lifetime supercharging, whichever you prefer @fredericlambert didn’t you get free supercharging for life? current buyers don’t get that. @annerajb @fredericlambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @digitaldunzey exactly. that’s monday. @officialjaden yes. will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. when safety looks good after 10m miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm. @pjj_knowles @yames51 @digitaldunzey no, but i will @mangehdbackup isn’t it obvious? @yames51 @digitaldunzey worth it @vincent13031925 @cleantechnica @cnbc @businessinsider @business @wsj @teslarati @insideevs true tesla autopilot drive on navigation going to wide release in north america tonight @sheldonth @factsdatatruth @tesla not exactly. we just bundled the upgrade package into performance. no problem if you want to return the car, but i think lifetime free supercharging is a good deal. @fb1975 @digitaldunzey haha @digitaldunzey on insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. on twitter, good posts get 1%. @_akhaten @nichegamer @raissabontempo @somegrayareas @reddit @twitter lacks scale @nichegamer @raissabontempo @somegrayareas @reddit @twitter reddit is massive, but def has gems @somegrayareas @reddit @twitter reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real reddit @mcgillligan exactly @factsdatatruth @tesla you’re right. earlier model 3 performance buyers got free lifetime supercharging. will add that to anyone who bought recently. on twitter, likes are rare &amp;

no discounts. competitors spent billions on marketing. model 3 was product alone. massive thanks to tesla owners &amp; supporters. we wouldn’t be here without you. @mikearildbrown @martyhungerford same @kevinjawbreaker 2025 how’d they know!?  https://t.co/azh4eorgmc @martyhungerford around mid 2019 @houmanhemmati @fredericlambert there have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past. @fredericlambert only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose @fredericlambert just did that to correct the front design esthetic of model s. the nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening. get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a tesla “refresh”. other car companies do this every ~3 years, but tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week. to simplify production, many tesla model s &amp; x interior configs, will no longer be available after nov 1. order now to be sure of the one you want. @cleantechnica model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars @vicentes working on it @jeanrodriguez3 that is correct twitter thought i got hacked &amp;

ice. we did our traction testing on an ice lake! dual motor awd is great, but not required for cold weather. just don’t use sport/summer tires. @dannymekic it’s a long range battery with fewer cells. non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~february just released lower cost, mid-range tesla model 3 &amp;

all tesla cars ever produced (except early roadsters) will get improvements for free. continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a tesla retains so much value over time. same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year just reviewed tesla’s service locations in north america &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! sorry for this foolish oversight. tesla will aim to cover all regions of na (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months. insightful article by david @pogue @id_aa_carmack thanks john, really admire you too! i think you’re one of the best engineers ever. hope you return to working on rockets one day. @jacksmacintosh @smilesimplify @j_brorsson @electrekco @fredericlambert the fsd upgrade is the tesla computer with our nn chip @smilesimplify @j_brorsson @electrekco @fredericlambert i believe it’s $5k @smilesimplify @j_brorsson @electrekco @fredericlambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. no change to sensors. this is simple replacement of the autopilot computer. will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving. @j_brorsson @electrekco @fredericlambert somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000% @electrekco @fredericlambert to be clear, actual nn improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. v9.0 vs v8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated gpu &amp; better use of discrete gpu. @electrekco @fredericlambert this is without the tesla nn computer. per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude. @electrekco @fredericlambert still a long way to go model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1m miles. designed for ultra high endurance. works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control @alguiretim @tesla haha. it is actually my fav game on tesla cars right now 😀 🖤🖤🖤🖤  🚘🚘🚘🚘  🖤🖤🖤🖤 @ttfue @tesla what are some of the most fun games we could have on a tesla? classic atari is just the start. @ttfue yes @cleantechnica thanks for recognizing the great work of the tesla team! 45,000 people now. it is time to create a mecha @surudenise nerv @shawnwasabi &lt;ahem&gt; elon-chan @stephanieeeeej great. also love princess mononoke. love your name  https://t.co/fru7ntwnml @sofiaan @vicentes @mrtommycampbell @tesla maybe this could be part of a (safe) car version of pokémon go style game @nikkoman82 @fiquett @yousuck2020 towelie 💗 @vicentes @mrtommycampbell @tesla good idea! @mrtommycampbell @tesla whole beer keg fits in model 3 trunk! @thingswork wow, mechanical logic gates @ckharrison10 @yousuck2020 comes with free towels. nothing more useful in the entire universe. @yousuck2020 maybe wise to bring it just in case 👽👾 😉 @owillis about half my money is intended to help problems on earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or ww3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves @owillis you should ask why i would want money. the reason is not what you think. very little time for recreation. don’t have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that. @technosucks yes tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on earth. even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. support makes a difference. thank you. visual approximation  https://t.co/smn3pv476y teslaquila coming soon … @astrohague @space_station @nasa_johnson @roscosmos glad you’re safe @mhmtkcn @tesla beautiful picture @insideevs @teslany @tesla yes, it’s hard to find. not sure why. @teslany @insideevs @tesla exactly. a tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to nhtsa’s *own* calculations. this is just physics! @financialtimes this is incorrect at falcon lz-1 vandenberg on sunday night with the base commander. support of @usairforce much appreciated.  https://t.co/76vsbkcn6n studebaker museum in south bend  https://t.co/odti9y0mcc @thomaspower @mvolpe punctuality is not my strong suit @snowsnowsnow @mvolpe we’d be nothing without our fans @mvolpe because 11 is obviously louder than 10 😀 @fredericlambert no such thing as a “full refresh” at tesla or even a model year. our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. there is no cadence. @wonderofscience it sure does. very reliable. @davidquearney you are right a reminder of why it’s important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power @justinemusk you’re most welcome, glad i could be helpful! thanks for letting me know about it. @jonostrower warms my ❤️ 😀 the physics of how tesla achieved best safety of any cars ever tested. note, when vehicle weight is taken into account, order is more like x,s, then 3, but they are all very close.  https://t.co/kb6rbscyyh (credit @_tomcross_)  https://t.co/zsrrvy2ids falcon has landed  https://t.co/joqphus1ao tesla owner shows how well ultrawhite seats hold up after 25,000 miles. the black &amp; white interior is def best imo.  https://t.co/vwq8x8jhyf @gnash what city &amp; what model 3 config? @crowarrior1978 my fav character sonic boom warning. this won’t be subtle.  https://t.co/wy7dn6bby1 @asbjornld @martinengwicht @jason @tesla two — one for 👽 👾 millions of years from now and one for you @martinengwicht @jason @tesla yes @incentives101 @jason @tesla yes, but 🐻 in 🧠 that we’re creating a generalized autonomy solution. must work in millions of strange 🚘 situations. blade runner — esper edition — vangelis  https://t.co/diwsrmada0 @jason @tesla actually, it’s 1 of 3 forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. external cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked. @martyeuler @mebfaber fair point 😀 @mebfaber when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. way the trick works is companies like blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. blackrock made $597m in short lending last year! @mebfaber not all. however, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  https://t.co/7jk2bs56hr @model3owners v9 moving to wide release now. holding back autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere. @mgerrydoyle only if they’re extremely tiny @megnsander we don’t judge. any pic you want! tesla owners can refer someone to buy a tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years @eugenegu rococo basilisk is first falcon 9 land landing mission from vandenberg air force base in california coming up soon! @annerajb @kishavanbhola @enn_nafnlaus @elonbachman the cio of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam @annerajb @kishavanbhola @enn_nafnlaus @elonbachman the big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. index managers like blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking. @dlauer @kishavanbhola @enn_nafnlaus @elonbachman debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder @kishavanbhola @enn_nafnlaus @elonbachman where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. the holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return. @kishavanbhola @enn_nafnlaus @elonbachman there is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators @erdayastronaut i hope to be less wrong over time @flintschools @muskfoundation you’re most welcome. hope to do more to help in the future. what they do should be illegal the last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned @fcalciu @derekgumb @scobleizer @tesla @sec_enforcement exactly. short-sellers are value destroyers. should definitely be illegal. by revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, model 3 actually outsold camry by a factor of two  https://t.co/1ztdk8hvjh @dailystem @lflemingedu @atkauffman @justinaglio @thetechrabbi @smgaillard @jsnhubbard @mrnavas @wickeddecent @gregkulowiec this is amazing  https://t.co/znae8p2nhs @model3owners almost ready. we expanded the early access program to 1000 more users a few days ago. people sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. so long as it makes great products, it will have great value. @bulltesla @iavor if you think tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. otherwise, buy. @iavor hang in there. if you are truly long-term, it will be fine. @scobleizer @tesla true @scobleizer @tesla sorry about the typo. that was unforgivable. why would they be upset about their mission? it’s what they do. just want to that the shortseller enrichment commission is doing incredible work. and the name change is so on point! great verdict 😀 @scottwww @cleantechnica could be worse 😇 @incentives101 @cleantechnica tesla autopilot team is awesome! got to make sure we iron out the details though. long tail of tricky edge cases. important to get front wide angle, b pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right. @cleantechnica something especially weird going on with yahoo news feed on iphone stocks app. almost always super negative. maybe getting gamed. naughty by nature 😉  https://t.co/muzdxjwjyz @krobertson @tesla @kimbal @senorsisig will do. definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars! @alitofts @telsa @6pm tesla will deliver your car to you. this is the future. the way it should work. that was intense @model3owners i❤️🇨🇦 @model3owners !! will take action. and remember …  https://t.co/uaduv4olzf huge thank you to all tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. you rock!! sorry for difficulties delivering your tesla due to high volume! critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable. @scottwww @tesla pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run @ctbarker32 @bdl3j @tesla you’re welcome. sorry for the delay! @agent_ko @starflightgame @spacex @starcontrolgame what would be great is original elite @neveryb going over final tweaks tonight. hopefully in wide release end of week. ♥️ tesla owners ♥️ @parkerwoolfolk increased tire pressure improves range. also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. better handling, but slightly lower range. @ftomenko @tesla 😀 @ctbarker32 apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load. @slashdot tricky one @dmc_ryan wow, thanks for offering to help! the coming week is incredibly intense. if any current tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to tesla delivery centers during midday on sat/sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated! @nasaspaceflight probably 2028 for a base to be built mars base alpha  https://t.co/o1llqp8rfy  https://t.co/fn0hkjd3uj @lanceulanoff consider an ice skater. same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. same principle is true for a car. @lanceulanoff front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn\\'t the right question. you can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good. @lanceulanoff simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at  https://t.co/cftq1v9ycl @lanceulanoff key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. this positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. extremely important metric. @martinengwicht @blondese a car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car @lanceulanoff yes, when it comes to physics, make sure newton is on your side @lanceulanoff helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details @martenbenjamin @nhtsagov @tesla exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much. @cardoso @nhtsagov haha true .@nhtsagov will post final safety probability stats soon. model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested. @lindseystirling 👽💘 @primadanna @tesla @alphacali wow, glad they’re ok! @vicentes @danaloni @slashdot physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality ♥️ @neiltyson @raginggoat @tesla tesla rangers! @cjdaniels77 31 engines, but with room to add 11 more down the road. kinda have to. @janeidyeve @slashdot yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldn’t spend computing power on sound @danaloni @slashdot yes true 😀  https://t.co/cs6semhkm6 @slashdot to conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed @megangale @tesla you’re most welcome! sorry for the delay. @erdayastronaut will do. love reddit. @cardoso @soundboy264 space bar @janeidyeve @ds23ytube long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go @perthguppy yeah, starlink should be active by then @lisapadgett @bocio777 @tarkesteijn sorry! so many bots!! moon mission will be livestreamed in high def vr, so it’ll feel like you’re there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light @bocio777 perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. there will be no obligation to do so. @ryaneshaghi very close  https://t.co/nqgfnwlm4z @oatmeal 😀 @jamesmarstersof @bioshock always @sleepingromi @yousuck2020 @rogerwaters @spacex @dearmoonproject yes @yousuck2020 @spacex that’s the first bfr airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material @mkbhd yeah … that’s exactly how i feel. however it happens, i just hope it does. @yousuck2020 thanks for helping fund a rocket &amp; spaceship that could take humanity beyond earth! hanging out with @yousuck2020 before the @spacex moon mission announcement  https://t.co/rtowutzmtg yusaku will be bringing 8 (brave) artists &amp; cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon! @martinengwicht @iamacloudguy @model3owners probably v10 alpha build @dmc_ryan @iamacloudguy @model3owners yes, albeit a beta version. will improve with v9.1. @iamacloudguy @model3owners good news on this front. tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of v9. going through final testing now. thank you for your trust in the @spacex team. greatly appreciated. @cleantechnica will be interesting to see how this evolves over time @nigelkbaker will see what we can do. really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. it’s not sustainable long-term. @martinengwicht very interesting due to some tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night @beardyman this is definitely worth thoughtful debate. what might we do differently to improve human/life happiness? @lanceulanoff @spacex @nasa yes, i do top spacex priority is and will remain supporting @nasa crewed spaceflight and national security missions btw, can’t emphasize enough how @spacex would not be where it is today without @nasa. thank you. @conormcdphoto with lasers @spacex my fav tweet ever @ummjackson if you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated @antvenom ok @swiftonsecurity maybe the scammers will just get tired of winning eventually @falcongridfin good catch. they are there in the flight design, but we forgot to put them in this render. #occupymars @vicentes forward moving wing  https://t.co/dupiavvm1z  https://t.co/d1kep44zjm @thepixelgeek 😉 @megangale @tesla sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. we’re making rapid progress. should be solved shortly. @roxanadaneshjou @boringcompany awesome 😎 @johnkoetsier design has been changed so the 🚀 lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control) @nirbheek sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn’t incent optimal behavior. we probably should have ended this earlier. @ddkilzer yes @thereal_scottv yeah, that’s our problem. service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks. @snazzyq outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000’s of makes &amp; models. tesla collision repair specializes in three. having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference. goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts. exciting to see some tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. aiming for same day soon, then under an hour. tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving tesla owners (and us) crazy @techgrltweeter true tesla owners can grant free supercharging for life to a friend who buys s/3/x. ends tomorrow night.  https://t.co/7zdxeiqvc7\" @thetrustysteed @tesla hi dustin! @joannmuller @alanohnsman @forbes the tesla board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in 100+ years, despite many setbacks. tesla owes its very existence to this board! @mcwm the muskrat is like a beaver with small ideas, but it has a certain quiet dignity … @mcwm wut?  https://t.co/sub8zftthk @mcwm haha 😀 @falcongridfin @spacex intentionally so electric cars made with sunlight @antvenom @spacex 🇯🇵 @falcongridfin @spacex yes bricks will be free if used for affordable housing projects @cleagentbrandon yes first boring brick store opening in ~2 months. only 10 cents a brick! rated for california seismic loads. @dylanstw__ @boringcompany about to finish first tbc hq building made with boring bricks in the shape of a medieval watchtower .@boringcompany will transport your car all the way into your garage @syrinxstarman @teslaroadtrip @tesla thoughtful feedback due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in north america, tesla customers may experience longer response times. resolving this is our top priority. @paulobriski @tesla my apologies, am working on this exact issue right now @adultswim @rickandmorty best show in the multiverse! @ebf no, service will stock all colors @dmc_ryan @edoublezero love that red. we tried every possible way to make red look 3d without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. we have to stop whole paint shop for red &amp; it looks like an episode of dexter. moving 2 of 7 tesla colors off menu on wednesday to simplify manufacturing. obsidian black &amp; metallic silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price. @theoceancleanup looks cool not easy coming up with a good cover story for an underground volcano lair, but i think it’s working test-driving our new boring machine with a 🎮 @tesla_bill @insideevs 2170 is about the right cell size, but i don’t recommend copying our current module design. far too difficult to manufacture. @caitylotz like sands through the hourglass … @pepicerie 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary &amp; those who don’t 🦊🐶 @karaswisher @themightyoo @itsmanibro will do soon, as promised @xjawz @rnaegels @joerogan @peterthiel @reidhoffman not me, i’m gonna die right here in the usa. or mars. just not on impact. i am a business magnet good times with @joerogan …  https://t.co/8uzusejoq1 @andrew_gold_ will add a fade mode with only essential info tesla 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd in august sales will be on @joerogan at 9:30pm pacific on thursday @andrew_gold_ am running it in my car, but it’s not right yet. hopefully, will release to advanced early access users in a week or two, then more broadly towards end of month. @mliebow @tesla much appreciated! great word-of-mouth is why model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements. @fredericlambert @pooktd the multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity @pooktd sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. if need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. got to be done. @cnn can steve bannon please insult me some more? best pr i’ve had in a while. @electrekco @fredericlambert ! @glamandgore i was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned @johnnacrider1 v cool @yoda @rmac18 @tijenonaran so you actually did nothing &amp; yet imply you are a truth-seeker. the twitter name you chose is @yoda. @yoda @rmac18 @tijenonaran answer the question @yoda. you brought it up, not me. did you investigate or not? if so, what did you actually do? @mcmurchie @alexmd2 @techmeme @catherineshu at this point, i want eth even if it is a scam @yoda @rmac18 @tijenonaran did you investigate at all? i’m guessing answer is no. why? @alexmd2 @techmeme @catherineshu it’s coming, i swear @yoda @rmac18 @tijenonaran you don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? he was offered free legal services. and you call yourself @yoda … @techmeme @catherineshu great actions by twitter to delete bogus accounts. will increase usage by real users. @tijenonaran for the record, my voice cracked once during the ny times article. that’s it. there were no tears. @theianchen @tesla sure :) @jwiechers @swiftonsecurity i want that outfit the world lost a great man in john mccain. he was an honorable, kind, brave and fundamentally decent human being. if only there were more such people in the world. @growthhackers this is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without @seanhquinn @yanquetino @tesla this is utterly false. fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. tesla gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by tesla solar) by end of next year. @yanquetino @tesla most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs. @j_brorsson @insideevs @tesla @airresources most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with model 3 production system. wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time … @insideevs @tesla @airresources maybe … @askdrstupid this was key showstopper for me personally. couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary spv, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors. @electrekco @fredericlambert the extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still @electrekco @fredericlambert what’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing tesla supercharger network and an extension cord @tesla in talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. this was also a factor in remaining public. @nichegamer it’s almost done @isco__ yes 😀🖤🚀, looks brutal otherwise this is actually real this time, the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer &amp; spacex will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising designs. bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of sound! @ashleyesqueda tesla car karaoke hopefully ready in ota software update version 10. just played missile command, asteroids &amp; lunar lander in v9. really fun! @electrekco i was just there. cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught fire. super appreciate fast response by fremont fire dept! no injuries or damage to factory. goal is to service your car wherever you are, quietly &amp; quickly. no need to bring it to a tesla service center. @model3owners ok love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. 🖤the red and the black♥️ @voxpolitico so many saved drafts. so … so many. @voxpolitico i’m dying to @tldtoday @tesla cool, lmk if you have suggestions for improvement after you drive it @cathiedwood thank you for the thoughtful letter @tldtoday @tesla thanks for buying our car! would highly recommend performance version. it’s really good &amp;

delightful to see. @fredericlambert @woodhaus2 production design will be better, especially in details. we are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of model 3 &amp;

ap hardware chart by @lexfridman at mit  https://t.co/6vzxkmcec2 investor support is confirmed. only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote. @mindfieldmusic def no forced sales. hope all shareholders remain. will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. ends negative propaganda from shorts. @thatspacegeek yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like spacex) @fredericlambert no change shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private @heydave7 absolutely. am super appreciative of tesla shareholders. will ensure their prosperity in any scenario. @gfilche my hope is *all* current investors remain with tesla even if we’re private. would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with tesla. already do this with fidelity’s spacex investment. @evotorentals yes @fredericlambert i don’t have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. i won’t be selling in either scenario. good morning 😀 @lizclaman @tesla 420 am considering taking tesla private at $420. funding secured. @chillinquillen @joerogan maybe thursday @gdb @openai @blitz_dota great work by @openai. need the neural interface soon to enable human/ai symbiosis. @excellion we’re working on a new tesla mini-car that can squeeze in an adult @khoji yes @rengle820 model s p100d is def still the top end, but model 3 performance is higher value for money @lexiheft early access will have bugs (usually minor, but you never know for sure), so would not advise early access unless you’re prepared to have something go wrong @scobleizer 🖤 tesla autopilot team 🖤 @vicentes @vishaljotshi everywhere … @lanceulanoff @vishaljotshi much more interesting @chriscardinal games &amp;

thanks for supercharger trophy reminder. really want to make the car as fun as possible! @megazone @ryanhummer @atari yup @jlgolson @atari hoping to include last three in this release, with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel (while stationary tbc haha) @ryanhummer @atari we will try to squeeze it in @jlgolson @atari what are your favorites? @austjennings yes @nantonius @atari yes @lexiheft @atari yes some of best classic @atari games coming as easter eggs in tesla v9.0 release in about 4 weeks. thanks @atari! falcon 9 launches iridium to orbit from vandenberg air force base  https://t.co/7gtzx0a24d @tictoc tragic. will send einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time. @worldandscience and most of remaining 0.14% is jupiter. we are tiny dust on tiny dust. @discovermag science ♥️🔬💫  https://t.co/hianwrrzwm @discovermag oh yeah? i’ll see ur expert &amp; raise you a chris mckay @nasa 🌏🚀👨\\u200d🔬 😀 https://t.co/lexpf93ryt @aswhiting tesla body shops are ramping up fast. aiming to go from 30+ days using external body repair shops to same day body repair with prestocked parts at tesla service centers. @4nikkolas @samir will leave any comment on actions in flint to those in flint @ilehonardo can’t wait to bring tesla to brazil. one of my favorite countries! @l9cgv we should be really worried about this @samir no @andredalmeida yeah, model 3 is designed to fit 6’4”  adults comfortably in both front &amp; rear seats at same time we’re adding a “party &amp; camper mode” soon to s/3/x, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music &amp; power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. big batteries rock … not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there’s room for trunks in front &amp; back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car @tesla hard drive industry is hardcore. they build &gt;100 million units per year with extreme precision &amp; brutal economics. great background. @discovermag there’s a massive amount of co2 on mars adsorbed into soil that’d be released upon heating. with enough energy via artificial or natural (sun) fusion, you can terraform almost any large, rocky body. @jbaert yes, minifloats @martinengwicht yes we tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owner’s home, so super convenient &amp; car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap @martinengwicht @grimezsz was listening to jon hopkins’ singularity with c, but posted this instead  https://t.co/pctxeidekx @hussi_tussi have wanted to for so long, but that would be irresponsible @kingter74261333 @neuralink all are important. you will see. 8-bit floating point? @mr_computique if any formula instantiates reality, it’s probably that think once, tweet twice [do it] 0 nothing is both real &amp; imaginary @j_m_0_n @tesla yes the future is accelerating @fermatslibrary 😱 @smilesimplify @emrekelly @nextspaceflight probably ships next summer @nextspaceflight side boosters, yes, but too much load through center core 🖤🚀💫 @electrekco @fredericlambert this is great. @phil_hellmuth @tesla thanks phil @alexgarnerart @whattheffacts machines that go “ping” @whattheffacts what’s technology? worth another retweet. hope dan neil returns to twitter. he left due to relentless attacks from short-sellers, who constantly peddle fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt about tesla. dan won the pulitzer &amp; is considered by many to be the best car critic in the world.  https://t.co/txw3ddjpth @westcoastbill explains why there are so many cat videos @antvenom @bbcbreaking localized electro-magnetic field generators @iridiumboss @spacex @spotify @marine_layer thanks for taking a chance on @spacex so many years ago! looking forward to using the new iridium constellation. wagnerian  https://t.co/mjt0bncdiy @dflieb @tesla yes mötor trēnd  https://t.co/jilxfhjkyw @appljd great! @appljd we’ve gone from ~1000 s/x deliveries per week in us last year to ~6000 s/3/x. it’s like hitting a square wave. @appljd we’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. should just be “tap here &amp; you get your car”. then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product. @westcoastbill yeah. never seen it so high ever. @willfealey @tesla @teslaownersuk wow, that’s really awesome. thank you! ♥️@teslaownersuk @arstechnica haha @nextspaceflight @electrekco looks good, but so many details need to be right. journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. altitude is easy, velocity is hard. @electrekco only costs that actually apply to q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. it would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter. wall street @hyperloop @spacex congratulations to all teams in the student @hyperloop competition! to make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. was great to meet everyone! @huby @87spider @ryan_caldbeck @tesla exactly. overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked. @ryan_caldbeck @tesla yes, tesla model s, x &amp; 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked  https://t.co/yvkwqfplbm @danfromtheweb ok @antvenom @ca_via_greenbay makes me very sad indeed, but also the fault is mine by far @antvenom he’s a good guy @ca_via_greenbay always look on the bright side of life … @antvenom it is much better @jd_2020 sorry 🤗  https://t.co/ys9qlwcnpc 🦄💨✌️  https://t.co/8gjqcbsuo0 @mitchellrossman @danfromtheweb i love that scene @danfromtheweb i made that up tbh. they did not have phones during the french revolution. they used friendster. @danfromtheweb don’t make me bite my thumb at you @janeidyeve for sure @danfromtheweb btw, 1792 is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. seriously, what museum do you plan to raid? @annerajb @boringcompany yeah, great point. underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds. no kidding @annerajb @danfromtheweb yes, that will probably be its first use @danfromtheweb phew 😅. yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make tesla successful. am honored to work with them. are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? what motivates you? @danfromtheweb i apologized. do you stand by your guillotine statement or not? @danfromtheweb figuratively, literally or both? @geekypastimes that has always been our goal @annerajb @flyfiddlesticks @patrickc @stevesi this chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not us government missions. “other us” refers to boeing &amp; lockheed. their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours. @vincent13031925 @bonnienorman @jason @scottwww dunno where this bs is coming from. who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 s/x and 5000 model 3 *new* net orders. @dmc_ryan definitely. we gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. you might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires. @marker2002 @kevinbusch @paracidic @otgray310 wow, someone has really thought about this! i wish @adamchavez nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that i apologize to mr. unsworth and to the companies i represent as leader. the fault is mine and mine alone. @adamchavez as this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after mr. unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested i engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader. @lrroberts87 good point @nealboudette @bertelschmitt @amazingchevvolt i have never donated to a superpac @danielbrennan yes, about 0.5% of what i donated to @sierraclub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue reports that i am a top donor to gop are categorically false. i am not a top donor to any political party. thank you for fighting climate change. this affects every living creature on earth.  https://t.co/mm0cpaqlsn @jack_p that said, i do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). a nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. i have given vastly more to humanitarian causes. @stfuszn @jack_p so that they are willing to listen when i call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity @jack_p thanks jack. to be clear, i am not a conservative. am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. doesn’t mean i’m moderate about all issues. humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; i don’t understand why they are not important to everyone. @atomicdeke @aarong @ajanitpv actually true @premkrmufc @ipugsiehd hold up a mirror &amp; see if it fogs @johndstoll @wsj @mtbarra i’m honored to work with an amazing group of people at tesla, but always happy to talk to an ace who might want to join @mrkylefield @neuroecology @thegrugq safe to lick. i checked. @nasaspaceflight in a month or so @ipugsiehd will check with our cat, schrödinger, but i don’t think she’s going to like it @ipugsiehd spoiler alert. next thing you’ll tell me is they don’t like pajamas. feels like a show &amp; tell weekend. i wonder what the cat dragged in … @neuroecology @thegrugq don’t be too quick to lick. that could go wrong. look closely &amp; smell first. ur welcome. @aarong @ajanitpv lvl 16 neutral good half-elf fighter/magic-user @renatakonkoly yes @lanceulanoff wizard alien 🧙\\u200d♂️👽 @ajanitpv yeah, but i got 100 gp &amp; roc feather of never-ending tickles wrote in grimoire, joined fellowship  https://t.co/cfybo3zofe interesting read  https://t.co/6vvietypiy @tesla whether you plan to buy a dual motor performance model 3 or not, take it for a test drive anyway. it’s like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you want. @tesla @92107runner performance version suspension is 1cm lower &amp; has stronger brakes in upgrade package @malala @malalafund happy birthday, malala! happy to support. @designheretic @littlemissflint gathering input this week, will begin taking action next week and let people know how they can help @m3chwarri0r935 @itsmikeski @deadpoolmovie even have the url  https://t.co/bouoek5cvy @winterspb @itsmikeski hmm, could def make some pretty sweet high-tech micro-missiles in arrow form @itsmikeski if you have cool arrows, you’re in @toddkorpi @starfire2258 ok, thanks. will let you know. @karenaboutflint @dylansheamusic sure, will call tomorrow @isco__ they should go where their heart takes them, but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics &amp; engineering with my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of history, philosophy &amp; luck with vice president wang in 中南海紫光阁  https://t.co/phd52ytzd2 excellent meetings with senior leaders in china. very thoughtful about the long-term future. @hohocho would love to. it’s been too long. @aparanjape prob early next year just finished an amazing 3 day visit to china. the world has never seen human energy &amp; vigor at such scale. incredibly impressed with tesla china team &amp; potential for the future. @thanr sure 🌌 💫 @mickyni111 look, at least it’s not the magellanic clouds. they’re basically next door. just between us, i have a teleportation stargate to the andromeda galaxy. it’s amazing.  https://t.co/elqr4pleix so true  https://t.co/dlagzixyhm @vivek_17m @thanr the pumps i saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. they stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. that was great work. @thanr sounds good @thanr glad to hear that. engineering team also getting feedback from the british dive team on how to improve the design for future applications. @vissmeerr @arsenaldem @pvols1979 @cnet it will happen for sure. damn. @greymusic should drive temp to target. why fan speed on app? @arsenaldem @pvols1979 @cnet lots of fake accounts on twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. wonder why. @tammyharrington @d20_highroller damn, now i want donuts 🍩 @d20_highroller yeah @shplatt @starfire2258 good point. maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros. @starfire2258 you’re right on both counts. most houses in flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. some houses are still outliers. will organize a weekend in flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good. @jonodiener maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation? @jonodiener for now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. creating email flint@x.com, but i’m in china so that won’t be working until tomorrow. @dylansheamusic please consider this a commitment that i will fund fixing the water in any house in flint that has water contamination above fda levels. no kidding. @jack great move @vanschneider why sir … 😊 stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome @kirklandjones good point @annerajb definitely. can’t wait to try that. been a little distracted past few months on mostly tesla matters, but back at it soon. @zainraz4 yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline well … it looked smaller on paper catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big  https://t.co/wmenzeksrq @katheri93719178 @dtemkin yes. caves are now filled with water again. difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue. @johnnasabri @dtemkin it sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. i suppose that is what religion tells us. wonder what i should do differently. @rockypruitt @kulpability @donandrewbailey @haydentiff @theferris_wheel @100k_ideas @gotchuw makes a lot of sense @dtemkin this reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. we were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. something’s messed up if this is not a good thing. @hankgreen @goodedesign i think the person who attacked me on twitter will survive somehow @hankgreen @eehouls thanks for correcting me. i meant to say over half a million people. @donandrewbailey @haydentiff @theferris_wheel @100k_ideas @gotchuw please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water @donandrewbailey @theferris_wheel @100k_ideas @gotchuw please lmk results of your water tests @donandrewbailey @theferris_wheel @100k_ideas @gotchuw when you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead? @dmc_ryan should be very soon. we’ve already made around 100 model 3 performance cars for test drives in stores. @bevvscott @eehouls exactly @eehouls no, it means i created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. what have you done? @hellocullen already have @blake_kistler @bbcworld ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. i wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that i still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. just the scale has changed. @lanceulanoff @bbcworld good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time. @sarthk007 @bbcworld yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point @bbcworld moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, spacex engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time. @bbcworld the former thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. that would be dick stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. this is our direct correspondence:  https://t.co/dmc9l3jizr great news that they made it out safely. congratulations to an outstanding rescue team! @teslamodel3fan @tesla ok just returned from cave 3. mini-sub is ready if needed. it is made of rocket parts &amp; named wild boar after kids’ soccer team. leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. thailand is so beautiful.  https://t.co/ehnh8ydatt @noizey_man @janeidyeve that would be cool. i wonder what it’s like under all that ice. @enochko @anna_online a second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete @janeidyeve yes. those videos are from this morning. @anna_online according to divers who have made the passage, yes. however, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage. simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage  https://t.co/2z01ut3vxj @2morrowknight thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. it is all other people. @bweikle according to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages @binarybits @janeidyeve tube diameter is 31cm @janeidyeve mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. hopefully useful. if not, perhaps it will be in a future situation. thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool @imscoops it is an honor to work with them with some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space  https://t.co/d1umifdr1t @iamjohnmcmahon i want to know who is running the etherium scambots! mad skillz … @docjohng @pewellaclarke @dcliem it is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward @kylebrubaker diver weight belts wrapped around outside. mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections. @ppathole @jimmyvosika @dcliem yeah, that sounds cool. music makes things better. calms the mind. adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player. @astrography__ @dcliem aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. if ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm. @dcliem   https://t.co/jl2spt0ncp @dcliem buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. they’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments. @montanaseptic @dcliem testing for 3 more hours in la, then it’s on a plane to thailand @dcliem design based on dive team feedback (primarily stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. dual o-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. leak/buckling proof to 10x cave water pressure. @vcastillo630 @adblanche i am an engineer @annerajb @kulpability @sivarajkumar237 @ko_sulli @grady_booch @slashdot tight control code is always c @annerajb @sivarajkumar237 @ko_sulli @grady_booch @slashdot python is done right. great name story too. @docjohng @dcliem if i am a narcissist (which might be true), at least i am a useful one @sivarajkumar237 @ko_sulli @grady_booch @slashdot 🖤🖤🖤 python 🖤🖤🖤 @dcliem pretty close. there is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit. @ko_sulli @grady_booch @slashdot turbo @grady_booch @slashdot c @ayshardzn given chiang rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed us was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. will continue testing in la in case needed later or for somewhere else in future. @dowdedward will do. even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation. extremely talented dive team. makes sense given monsoon. godspeed.  https://t.co/t5xro3gtxk @slashdot yes @dirkbonhomme @jeltedesign @maysacha yes @jeltedesign @maysacha fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy. @abroadwithalec @maysacha yes @maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops. @thanr @ablack82 i’m in la working with the spacex team building the kid mini-sub @aiyanaskye construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to thailand continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in thailand. human character at its best. got more great feedback from thailand. primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of falcon rocket as hull. light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. extremely robust. @voltzcoreaudio ground winds would @voltzcoreaudio yes. all-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. it’s a beast. @jevjack1 can’t be too buoyant some good feedback from cave experts in thailand. iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does. @arkadiuszkula @jl2579 @mattyice4412 @thanr @jamesworldspace good idea @jl2579 @mattyice4412 @thanr @jamesworldspace prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for scuba mouthpiece or regulator. training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack. @littlemissflint you’re welcome. happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂 @mattyice4412 @thanr @jamesworldspace yeah, that’s what i’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer kevlar pressure pod with teflon coating. other approach is a long inflatable air sock. both worth trying. @williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @jamesworldspace exactly. you can put socks on your feet the same way. there would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall. @jeremysliew it’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution @siwgrindaker @erikveen should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. if oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large. @erikveen i would def recommend this @thanr @jamesworldspace building double-layer kevlar pressure pods with teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done scuba. do the divers think something like this might work? @bonnienorman @teslabull @trippedover interesting @thanr @jamesworldspace great, thanks @jamesworldspace inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of kevlar for better abrasion resistance. a spacex engineer happens to be in thailand &amp; is headed there now. could one of the divers dm me? need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab. @ladykayaker @jamesworldspace so long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in @thanr @jamesworldspace does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? what frequency? will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. beyond that, only batteries will work. will prep powerwalls in case needed. @jamesworldspace spacex &amp; boring co engineers headed to thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. there are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person. @jamesworldspace looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. if depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit. @chiefpad @jamesworldspace so long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. this is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10x to 1000x more power. @chiefpad @jamesworldspace have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction) @ladykayaker @jamesworldspace walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. if tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. just need to duck for the narrow sections. @jamesworldspace maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole. @cate_long @lopezlinette exactly. a journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles. @melissaleecnbc @thesheetztweetz @cnbc @lebeaucarnews i know you &amp; believe you, but it means lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said @jowens510 @lopezlinette i didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. they just don’t like hypocrites. @lopezlinette they were sent to me by multiple people on the internet. i don’t use facebook. @thesheetztweetz @cnbc @lebeaucarnews lopez wrote that melissa lee of cnbc was “dancing her face off” with chanos in vegas. is this true?  https://t.co/jy7sqkz4r5 @s_padival @lopezlinette why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about chanos’s cuff links? who took the pic? obv not objective  https://t.co/ealvigwm7k @s_padival @lopezlinette   https://t.co/ystkbf7p1w @s_padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in vegas with chanos &amp; tepper with caption “love both these dudes”. doesn’t sound very objective  https://t.co/oy1tz6cg68 @rayhawn @tesla norwegians are right to be upset with tesla. we are having trouble expanding our service facilities in oslo especially. can solve quickly with tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so. @ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? why won’t lopez go on record saying that she never offered tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of tesla ip? @tombrechet @vassilyk @flatjannrickles @vincent13031925 @teslabull @scottwww @stetopinini @s_padival @lopezlinette @tesla sounds fishy. how did that go down? @steveshmidt @thesheetztweetz @cnbc @lebeaucarnews true @vincent13031925 @teslabull @scottwww @stetopinini @s_padival @lopezlinette so @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for chanos, tesla’s most prominent short-seller. in her words, he is “one of the greatest.” her articles print chanos’s view verbatim. this is not journalism. @scottwww @stetopinini @s_padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette you stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with chanos, the most prominent short-seller of tesla. have you ever provided him with material non-public information about tesla? @teslabull what a coincidence … @thesheetztweetz @cnbc @lebeaucarnews am not attacking all media or even all of @cnbc. just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show. @stetopinini @s_padival @lopezlinette indeed, very simple question. to be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate martin tripp for inside information about tesla? did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue? @benjaminpollock @cnbc exactly. @cnbc, i just asked a simple question. please answer. @icannot_enough @simriyat @gawwy @aperezposada @reuters @sal19 strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion. note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. car is driving entirely by itself.  https://t.co/xsg2mmy756 @s_padival @lopezlinette sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of tesla’s biggest short-sellers? an ex-tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable tesla ip in exchange. is this true? @s_padival @lopezlinette has published several false articles about tesla, including a doozy where she claimed tesla scrapped more batteries than our total s,x &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible. @gawwy @aperezposada @reuters @sal19 wow, so @sal19 of @reuters wrote article that misled public about model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. nice work @sal19 &amp; @reuters. @aperezposada @reuters .@reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number? @aperezposada @reuters .@reuters is relentlessly negative about tesla. they just wrote a bogus article saying s production last week was low by 800 cars. s/x annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. tesla built 1,913 s/x cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target. @littlemissflint happy to support @mabzmagz boring co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp;

simpler than most. @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. uaw and wall street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at tesla. storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate. @doctorow @dimas_______ @robotbeat then look a little closer, doctorow. read the whole thread. @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow more propaganda. the nda only prevents disclosure of tesla proprietary ip or material non-public information (insider trading). @teslacharts how big is your short position? just curious. @bobbiebees @dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. i know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. this one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant. @doctorow i endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel tesla is a good company. uaw has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right. @dimas_______ @robotbeat @doctorow uaw doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. they can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. such creeps. @thesithseth @doctorow i’m not against all unions, but uaw has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. our current factory went bankrupt under uaw before we took it over. don’t want tesla to die too. @robotbeat @doctorow i am too, of sorts. govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people. @antvenom @shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @spacex was originally called puff the magic dragon, as people said i was high if though it could work, so i named it after their insult. @doctorow iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the culture books. at all. and wouldn’t be in the case of tesla. banks was about freedom through &amp;

i bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. that obviously failed. @carltontsc there is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. by latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1b is a billionaire. government is the largest corporation. socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. what really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom. @jack_frodo universal income will be necessary over time if ai takes over most human jobs @antvenom marx was a capitalist. he even wrote a book about it. @antvenom a socialist those who proclaim themselves “socialists” are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp;

size of those streams. @fernandogords68 @billnye @neiltyson strongly disagree. i love humanity. @lanceulanoff @lea_bitterwolf @jlgolson already did. meant to go longer, but ran out of time.  https://t.co/s8g76wtqll @lea_bitterwolf @jlgolson i always wanted to do a terms &amp; conditions cover of green eggs &amp; ham @gcortes foundation series &amp; zeroth law are fundamental to creation of spacex @paulverstegen1 i love banks. best books in recent years imo are iain banks &amp; george martin. @jlgolson given how bad i am at poetry, probably vogon should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. it’s pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by douglas adams &amp; isaac asimov. @annerajb @fredericlambert my donations are anonymous @fredericlambert already sold &gt;$100m tsla for charity. will do about that every few years. major disbursements in about 20 years when tesla is steady state. my “pay” is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; i sell. will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on earth w my foundation. just don’t want us to be sad about the future.  https://t.co/l3yevjvyuz @ralphbakshi dankonia @korihale @tesla @culturebanx @forbes we use less than 3% cobalt in our batteries &amp; will use none in next gen @kwang0429 yes, interface will change with version 9 software @ifnd323 will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean “slight up or downward force on the wheel”, not really “hold the wheel” @arctechinc some very, very tough calls. had to let go of good people, but i think they will find new jobs quickly. difficult, but necessary tesla reorg underway. my email to the company has already leaked to media. here it is unfiltered:  https://t.co/4ltowoxscx @nabilzouhir1 @mayemusk @kimbal that is actual footage @mayemusk @kimbal back in the precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge @joerogan @off_thewalls @mkbhd thanks! have heard universally great things about your podcasts. @garyflickinger @ochamsrazr @vr0nline of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. people can obv read the internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. i predict basically zero. the honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again. @erdayastronaut @lord_lima_bean @uhddreamer @lanceulanoff trade is just that roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. copv in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons @lord_lima_bean @uhddreamer @lanceulanoff exactly. total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. the composite overwrapped pressure vessel (copv) is most advanced ever made. it’s what spacex is qualifying for nasa crewed missions. extremely robust — literally bulletproof. @caio_1999_ @lanceulanoff not recommended for urban environments @thatguyknapp @lanceulanoff yes @poriya_ravi @worldandscience the actual amount of time i spend on twitter is tiny. my tweets are literally what i’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda. @oheather1337 @worldandscience it is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. a complicated one is relatively easy. @worldandscience love this design. simpler the better. @deelex_mcem @vhollywood21 add an r for roadster 👽💕🚀 @raptorweb sigh. this is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. @off_thewalls @mkbhd @joerogan a lot of people whose judgment i respect have suggested this. sounds like a good idea. will do so after model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady. @vhollywood21 yes. hopefully, i’m not tempting fate too much with that date. it was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing. @mkbhd will do @bartjehoel @djenkins6 correct, pure electric. wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping newton’s third law. spacex is already developing high efficiency co2 capture with h2o to form liquid ch4 (methane) &amp; o2. critical for propellant production at mars base alpha. @mkbhd you have my word, marques. next gen roadster will be absolutely out of this world. for those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another. @lanceulanoff note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a spacex rocket copv bottle. the air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time. @lanceulanoff intent of new tesla roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric. @anandrajk @lexiheft @tesla that issue is better in latest autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in august update as part of our long-awaited tesla version 9. to date, autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. with v9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features. this is why i’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while i was in newsrooms all round the world say that if i only knew how newsrooms really worked, then i’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like pravduh 🤔 zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the ny times, boston globe &amp; knight-ridder websites. nyt, kr &amp; hearst were all major investors in zip2. @trace_remick @fredericlambert 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak cpus with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function. @fredericlambert in early 90s, i wrote a multitasker for pcs that spoofed the cpu &amp; cd-rom to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. required c++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of cpu registers. that company’s name was rocket science. fate loves irony. @fredericlambert that’s quite a blast from the past! after my zip2 experience w patents, i felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. i aspired to file zero patents after that. in 2014, we open-sourced all tesla patents  https://t.co/hpk5r5ums6 at zip2, i wrote entire v1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in us (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early yelp). also wrote v1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps. more background: i arrived in north america at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. paid my own way thru college. dropped out of stanford eng/phys grad school w $110k in college debt. created internet startup w bro &amp; greg khouri (love bro &amp; loved greg, may he rip) @frankippolito @boringcompany we don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but the boring company is donating $10k. @djenkins6 using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in copv, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. but we are going to go a lot further. 19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, i had to decide between buying a house in palo alto or a mclaren f1 (best car ever imo). was no contest. i bought f1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. new tesla roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way… spacex option package for new tesla roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. these rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. maybe they will even allow a tesla to fly … terms &amp; conditions for “not-a-flamethrower”  please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. for simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great dr seuss book “green eggs and ham”.   #throwflamesresponsibly  https://t.co/kgj8w8eolj almost forgot! due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a flamethrower, we have renamed our product: “not a flamethrower”. @darth_schmoo yes @spphotonic each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art the boring company brand fire extinguisher.   will offer a tbc ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter. flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/bbq. no more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! if no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! it will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs. @teslamarcus1 coming soon @mikesidneyphoto i think so :) nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a tbc flamethrower  https://t.co/hewjf66hh2 first 1000 boring company flamethrowers being picked up today!  https://t.co/hbmp5fgzab @teslaology @dmc_ryan @tesla we’re building out tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome @dmc_ryan talked with tesla team. looks like we can do the aluminum model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from s). turning on production for model 3 performance version. @pmnordkvist gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. rollout of solar already begun. @nate_072 @spacex yeah, actually closer to skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter and we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. lesson learned. @mkbhd definitely. will also have augmented mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. like a flying metal suit, but in car form … running track in @spacex bf spaceship will look something like this  https://t.co/563uptfv58 @dmc_ryan no plans for aluminum pedals. adds too much production complexity. model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for s &amp;

everything’s just fine  https://t.co/cg4ooqsrx3 @stcom why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? in bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. this is not healthy. @stcom the results speak for themselves. singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars. glad you’re ok!  https://t.co/zuuycuikus some details on the tesla air filtration system  https://t.co/krpwg7tgsu @nickg_uk mid 2019 for rhd @nashlib that sounds like a fun adventure! @nickg_uk you can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp;

point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. many fit this description, but consumer reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism. @electrekco @fredericlambert ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than cr car, which was early production. wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. only affects range by ~2%. @annerajb @henry_pivac prob 8.3 @henry_pivac yes all items below will go to all model 3s within next few months with v8.2 software. to report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description.  https://t.co/ea7fton2ce @prakash_d @grillick @indianinterest “pneumatic” means propelled by air. opposite of hyperloop. @mactechgenius @v_g_fischer @consumerreports braking &amp; ui upgrades apply to all model 3s. improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort. @v_g_fischer @consumerreports yeah, absolutely really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @consumerreports. road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. ui improvements coming via remote software update later this month.  https://t.co/zmlpjxmplm like you guys too 🚘 🖤  https://t.co/pvqvyr1nxy @indianinterest actually, hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp;

i said that was false. are you saying i don’t have the right to deny false accusations? that’s messed up. @noahshachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba you’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that i’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too @amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @sra_mister @waitbutwhy great book. read it when it came out. @amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @sra_mister @waitbutwhy exactly @rhinopiasty spacex has area 58 at cape canaveral. that’s 7 better than 51. @amasad @sra_mister yeah @amasad @sra_mister second best answer to the fermi paradox after the simulation argument @johnnasabri @sra_mister which part? love their cuisine. and the views are amazing. @ppathole @sra_mister yes @sra_mister there are no aliens. officially, at least … @worldandscience you have so many great pics &amp; factoids! @g_whitehead5 @dmc_ryan @model3owners @tesla yes, awd p first and then awd. production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. as production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money. @davidtayar5 @annerajb @liketeslakim i really want to make this cupholder @annerajb @liketeslakim a dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp;

@obviousparadox @medickinson @thephysicsgirl no @medickinson @thephysicsgirl nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. definitely indicates bs. sorry.  https://t.co/wqp8j9ykej @amywestervelt @weinbergersa yes, because tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. you don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches. @weinbergersa wow, you’re ignorant. don’t remember you, but disclosing classified us missile technology to hostile nations would violate itar law &amp; land you in jail. i didn’t review it, but my team did. obviously nobody cared about what your article said. please. @politifact @paypal @poynter done @jennineak have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets. @dx_1 be careful what you wish for  https://t.co/3msj15ueiw amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔 my point exactly  https://t.co/pq7pfqec3x @upulie ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. that is 100% synonymous with bs. @donny0m reddit is great come on media, you can do it! get more people to vote for you. you are literally the media. @passionplanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @jessicahuseman exactly. the point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. they don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public. @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @jessicahuseman why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? all they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt. @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @jessicahuseman i did to any who asked @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @jessicahuseman that was obvious from a mile away. i tried to use their product &amp; it didn’t work. not exactly a genius move by wsj, but they were brave enough to say it. @dmc_ryan @teslanomicsco @tesla maybe after you get your model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved @dmc_ryan @teslanomicsco but consider it real. we could unveil model y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so march 15 is about right. @dmc_ryan @teslanomicsco i just made that up, because the ides of march sounded good @eugenelee3 @karaswisher @jason gasoline or diesel? @karaswisher @jason what car do you drive? @teslanomicsco march 15 @mainhoonmaun the media @karaswisher hi kara! i’m open to it. right now, i’m cranking super hard at the tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week. maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “you’re right!”  i do actually own  https://t.co/1jqqcf9ina, but for the moment i just have it automatically forward to facebook news. @truthforcesteem @kali0x2a definitely @mrnobre there no good car emojis. i mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘 @cryptoalesio yo @benschwartzy that’s the basic idea for some reason, this is the best i’ve felt in a while. hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏 @politifact i just tried to donate, but you don’t accept paypal. lmk when you do. @adnroy um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do @southtopia thank you! i thought it was so obvious … @altwouss @jackallisonlol @parkermolloy exactly. uaw does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company. @politifact yeah, i think you do great work if you’re in media &amp; don’t want pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it … @meharris 🤗 @parkermolloy i’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. uaw abandoned this factory. tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. they haven’t forgotten uaw betrayed them. that’s why uaw can’t even get people to attend a free bbq, let alone enough sigs for a vote. @meharris of course @scottwww @jessicahuseman it is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. we are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company. @jessicahuseman @reveal no, they’re just some rich kids in berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously @ishashankbhatia will do create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets) @scotch_io that’s why editors are included too @sophiewarnes we don’t. the media is reporting someone else saying that tesla advertised. it is untrue. even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. it is how they define themselves. @detroitvictoria enough of the public does care about the truth. i have faith in the people. @antvenom maybe some good people from those orgs who would join @virtualanom not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army @sakiwebo exactly going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. thinking of calling it pravda … @dancow @wsj an exception that proves the rule @codybrown uh, this is twitter. how many characters do you want? problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. tricky situation, as tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers. @teddymonacelli the media has earned this mistrust. but maybe there is a solution. @jaspar oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again. @andyjayhawk thought you’d say that. anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “you’re just like trump!” why do you think he got elected in the first place? because no ones believes you any more. you lost your credibility a long time ago. the holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them  https://t.co/ay2dwcomkr @girllovesbread @zainraz4 @mashable this will sound super obvious, but genesis &amp; oblivion @johnbirmingham @mashable i am not cool @zainraz4 @mashable the one about to come out called so heavy i fell through the earth @mashable was sad to see g getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so i’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. her music

certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts @aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh) @austinonsocial great idea! @annerajb @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa will do it later this year. too much on plate right now. will be available as an upgrade from service. @deusex love original deus ex! that would be awesome. @uaw @speea @alterviggo @juliacarriew interesting he stops at ‘09. that’s when you drove gm &amp; chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you. @matthunter just order your car with the james bond option package. it’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa but ya know what, let’s test that theory. maybe we do want uaw back, even tho uaw betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. maybe we want uaw back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. maybe. let’s hold a vote &amp; find out. @speea @alterviggo @juliacarriew in theory true, but not how uaw behaved. they drove gm &amp; chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning nummi plant workers.tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.uaw destroyed once great us auto industry &amp; everyone knows it. we’re going to include some fun games as hidden easter eggs in tesla s, x &amp; 3. what do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen? @oldmanlink good point @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa no, uaw does that. they want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. that sucks. us fought war of independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. managing sucks btw. hate doing it so much. @mikeyfranklin @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa more “reveal” bs. tesla is overseen by cal/osha, most stringent labor safety org in us, &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. on other hand, ford, chrysler &amp; gm (uaw) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. strangely, that info is missing from reveal article … @sarahknuckey @jeffbezos @oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 no problem @sarahknuckey @jeffbezos @oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 they are incorrect. we never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet. @dmc_ryan @loganthefirst thanks again, have conveyed your words to the tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. really energizing! @sarahknuckey @jeffbezos @oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 i didn’t meet with him @dinisguarda i definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. need to have long uninterrupted times to think. can’t be creative otherwise. just wanted to say thanks to all tesla supporters. i damn well love you. @rrosenbl @electrekco @fredericlambert @tesla have been meaning to get around to talking to him. some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars. @dmc_ryan @loganthefirst thanks ryan. critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced. @samuelrogg @electrekco @fredericlambert to be clear, all model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. today’s model s is far more refined than initial production. @rrosenbl @electrekco @fredericlambert abs calibration algorithm @electrekco @fredericlambert also, consumer reports has an early production car. model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. will request that they test current production. @electrekco @fredericlambert looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. will be rolling that out in a few days. with further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. tesla won’t stop until model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car. @camgfrost @dmc_ryan @loganthefirst stop, you’re making me blush ☺️ @dmc_ryan @loganthefirst also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase model 3 performance power output a little @dmc_ryan @loganthefirst complexity is the devil. words can’t express how hard we are working on the model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. but we’ll try. @teslaology @electrekco @fredericlambert good point. yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations. @lanceulanoff the cr braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. if so, we will address this at our expense. first time we’ve seen anything like this. @electrekco @fredericlambert even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers @electrekco @fredericlambert very strange. model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. if there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. may just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an ota software update. @reveal @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa @al_letson cool, we can do the interview at tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com. @mrsyomaddy @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa gwynne’s awesome. been spacex prez for 10 years. super love working with her. @dani21 @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa ♥️🦄 @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa also, uaw did nada for job security in last recession. dropped fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in detroit. uaw *chose* to exit this plant before tesla even arrived. we had nothing to do with uaw leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs. @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa nothing stopping tesla team at our car plant from voting union. could do so tmrw if they wanted. but why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? our safety record is 2x better than when plant was uaw &amp; everybody already gets healthcare. @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. these are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by reveal. @maxrogo we’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a

probably unveil next gen supercharger late summer. major improvements all round. @ivanovi_ivaylo with production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. shipping min cost model 3 right away wd cause tesla to lose money &amp; die. need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k tesla &amp; live. @willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @mactechgenius that means nothing. literally your mom could file for nlrb. @mactechgenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington exactly 🚀💫🎉! that will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. difficult to justify before then. @marshall5912 @buckycovington @mactechgenius yeah, “reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make orwell proud. workplace injury rate of our factory when it was uaw w toyota/gm was twice as high as today’s non-union. @marshall5912 @buckycovington @mactechgenius about 2% of tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it. @aksingh_s yes @kinglutron @marshall5912 @buckycovington @mactechgenius exactly @marshall5912 @buckycovington @mactechgenius they can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing i can do to stop them. california is a very pro-union state. they just don’t want to. @paulmacguyscott upgrade to the latest s. nothing will give you greater joy. it’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will. @josh_soto they are correct. it’s awesome. second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from model s. traction control precision is super tight. @jimmyrussellexe it does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell @antvenom @zacharyj98 depends on when you placed your initial reservation. we start delivering the dual motor model 3 in july. @josh_soto three or four months, depending on demand level. we have enough for about 1000/week right now. @zacharyj98 good idea ... @mactechgenius that is true. electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. you need an electric motor just to start a gas engine! tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. one is optimized for power &amp; one for range. car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. cost of normal dual motor awd option is $5k. range is also 310 miles. takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph. @ppathole black &amp; white interior available only for model 3 performance initially due to limited parts availability. will broaden over time. tesla awd is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from autopilot). cost is $78k. about same as bmw m3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. will beat anything in its class on the track. tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph top speed 310 mile range @plot_qasc it’s only slightly more expensive to tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing @clemyeung exactly will soon enable tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. tesla ranger will come to you to take care of your car. no need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork. @everman @scottwww @kymmpuckeridge @elementc9 @griff_golf i’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight @addankisarat you can tweet to tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards @scottwww @kymmpuckeridge @elementc9 @griff_golf that is the way to go. thanks for buying our cars! @dmc_ryan also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” performance wheels, black &amp; white interior. @dmc_ryan ac induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. silicon carbide inverters in both. performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma

it appears so @kasabiii it certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. a system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released. what’s actually amazing about this accident is that a model s hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. an impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. it’s super messed up that a tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in us auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://t.co/6gd8mzd6vu @sokane1 @talktesla @techmeme @timkhiggins yes @talktesla @techmeme @timkhiggins according to nhtsa, there was an automotive fatality every 86m miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). tesla was every 320m miles. it’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a tesla. we will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter. @techmeme @timkhiggins this is false. eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. wsj fails to mention that tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. approx 4x better than avg.

propaganda to counter imf study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. even if $4.9b was true, combined market cap of tesla &amp; spacex is $80b. where did the other $75b come from? ass

white interior in july. air suspension prob later. note, that’s when we *start* making them. can’t instantly fill all orders. will take 6+ months to do so. @existentialcoms our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than tesla, which means tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as ev incentives declined. how strange … @anthonyfultz @dmc_ryan i love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp @dmc_ryan tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor awd &amp; performance. starting production of those in july. air suspension prob next year. @nextspaceflight a cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve

the call, i should have answered their questions live. it was foolish of me to ignore them. @joshgans we went through the same drama on s &amp; x and almost all confirmed in the end. will likely be even better for model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. i worry zero about demand. just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom. reason rbc question about model 3 demand is absurd is that tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0. the reason the bernstein question about capex was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter the 2 questioners i ignored on the q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors @marekcyzio exactly first, it’s important to know that tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while  https://t.co/srep1tf6zu please ignore this thread unless you’re

@mkbhd @hyperchangetv yeah, news is actually super good. model s &amp; x are producing major positive cash flow &amp; model 3 is about to do same. @mkbhd @hyperchangetv to be clear, i’m a big fan of mkbhd, but this is an important clarification @mkbhd @hyperchangetv the “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their tesla short thesis. they are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. hyperchange represented actual investors, so i switched to them. you’re most welcome  https://t.co/5lohswhwhc @drgitlin your numbers are

back to sleeping at factory. car biz is hell … @amir can’t believe you’re even writing about this. my job as ceo is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently model 3 production. doug, who i

doesn’t matter. @nocerabv @wsj @tesla not criticizing, just as asking questions. i’m sure there’s a really great answer … @wsj tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. this is absolutely the right thing to do. yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about tesla. why so? @omarhoryy @teslamotorsclub seriously! obviously, i’m not going to do an april fool’s joke about going bankwupt if i thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh). @teslamotorsclub lot of respect

@realdonaldtrump also, no us auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in china, but there are five 100% china-owned ev auto companies in the us @realdonaldtrump for example, an

@dsfpspacefl1ght that was three years ago, before ula cancelled all medium versions of delta iv. future missions have all delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600m+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. nutty high. @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght both exhaust velocity (isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. also thrust/mass matters a lot for oberth effect. delta upper stage isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not. @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght the performance numbers in this database are not accurate. in process of being fixed. even if they were, a fully expendable falcon heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a delta iv heavy, is $150m, compared to over $400m for delta iv heavy. love and rockets  https://t.co/vnnfxb1iig now, if i

@andressa_ojeda @franke @boringcompany hmm ... portal gun. now that would be interesting. you’d need millions of zombies for a so-called “apocalypse” anyway. where would i even get a factory big enough to make so many!? the rumor that i’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false @franke @boringcompany good thing you didn’t ask about the freezegun ... @franke @boringcompany hmmm unless you like fun obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. definitely don’t buy one. 1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left! when the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. works against hordes of the undead or your money back! don’t do this  https://t.co/e0q6ax60k5 @mkbhd atf says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is a-ok. our design is max fun for least danger. i’d be way more scared of a steak knife. great for roasting nuts 🔥 🥜  https://t.co/mgmksjhiyx the boring company flamethrower

kennedy. easy viewing from the public causeway. falcon heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. generated quite a thunderhead of steam. launching in a week or so.  https://t.co/npaqatbnir @sallyshin check  https://t.co/il3cwstpxr for updates @davidburrusdds done @thenosyt definitely. you will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. software team is focused on core model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features. @daniellefong @youngtreegrower @tylerdoor @id_aa_carmack there aren’t even good normal parties in silicon valley! @id_aa_carmack @daniellefong actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. there are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but i recommend keeping those parts original. @mister_millard @tesla that sounds cool. will do. @ppathole @tesla @teslarati @mkbhd fixed in next release long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (credit @johnkrausphotos)  https://t.co/x24k3han8m @omerldiri @tesla good idea. we can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park. @yoda of course. and an outdoor screen that plays

and a bunch of drivers first. major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. note, will be slower at first until code is optimized. @sustainableanna @vanseedbank similar total size. maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (i think) feature i’d like to add. @iamsamcrompton sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. that will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining model 3 ramp. @mcflashtube was gonna say we’ll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :) @madsveiby should be in next update @moskov done @vanseedbank i promise that we will make a pickup truck right after model y. have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. am dying to build it. @seanmahoneyap sorry for the delay. we have the most advanced ai neural net of any consumer product by far, so it’s going through exhaustive testing. the results are blowing me away though and i think you will have a similar experience. wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to tesla owners ww for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   so much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. i hope you do.  how can we improve further? @nicmedia123 we will! at least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks. @alhenry1231 the circle is complete @steven_mckie ok hats sold out, flamethrowers soon! @ultralightbeam it does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail @mrcsscco true so strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. given a set of possible explanations, why pick the extremely unlikely one!? @kwebbelkop yes having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens … when you get the new tesla software update, go ho ho ho. there’s an easter egg inside the easter egg, but it’s not funny. 46k limited edition boring hats sold, 4k to go. then flamethrower. i think last night might have been the biggest rorschach test ever @planet4589 @cristatolive @spacex isn’t it obvious? if you liked tonight’s launch, you will really like falcon heavy next month: 3 rocket cores &amp; 3x thrust. 2 cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. 3rd lands on

https://t.co/llndewbhbp @goodaudz @mtlbagelboy @paulkrugman his “phd” is in literature (really), presumably bad fiction @redletterdave how much is it? i love twitter @rbrome @paulkrugman bloody hell, i’m going to have to write a blog. can’t fit this into tweets. @ben_made_new @paulkrugman i would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart @paulkrugman however, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive. @youri_hart major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out. @paulkrugman for the record, i actually love trains, most subways and london buses. @paulkrugman idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “phd” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. that’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”. glad to see that tesla owners are having a good experience. working to improve further. some cool software updates coming soon.  https://t.co/16nabnheud @nickwadlow sorry about that. thanks for letting me know.

booster cores will come back and land. sides back at the cape, center on the droneship. falcon heavy launching from same @nasa pad as the saturn v apollo 11 moon rocket. it was 50% higher thrust with five f-1 engines at 7.5m lb-f. i love that rocket so much. max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. first mission will run at 92%. @clickhole hate it when that happens. some

misleading article that doesn’t actually represent my point of view at all. other publications referred to it as an “interview”. @humantransit sorry @humantransit you’re an idiot @wired this depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an ai conf, not from an interview with wired as is falsely implied. this is why i stopped following wired long

now. sending experienced installers from continental us to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible. @ismailnathij @stapf @tesla tesla always charges the same price for a powerwall (only taxes

@julieverhage let me check on that for you. found the answer right here: 🔥💩 @alexeheath @rolfewinkler @julieverhage it was misinterpreted by rolfe at wsj as a fundraising effort. neuralink is not seeking investors. @berlinhedgehog @jmackin2 wsj has been laboriously negative for over a decade. i\\'m surprised they haven\\'t bored their readers to death by now. @rolfewinkler @julieverhage neuralink is not raising money max recovered booster velocity was mach 7.9 (bulgariansat). energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears max velocity: mach 6.9 max altitude: 247 km highest so far, but velocity matters much more @rupertdance @voltzcoreaudio probably 2m or so @voltzcoreaudio exactly. yeah. @sroalf intentionally? yes @harshilshah1910 it is

authority is for falcon heavy, but also enables falcon 9 to land in heavier winds. @djsnm they will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. they do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that. @zerosixbravo slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. can take reentry heat with no shielding.  https://t.co/smyccqrt2f @sajo sticking to 100 @emerald0013 it\\'s an aluminum honeycomb

doing projects with big car companies was not great. they move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech. @samabuelsamid @teslamotors i\\'ve written two forward-looking master plans, but haven\\'t told the tesla history of how we got there. lot of drama … prob worth doing? @samabuelsamid @teslamotors mostly right. the feasibility study martin commissioned about the lotus elise was dead wrong though. only 7% of parts ended up being common. @ritspex @id_aa_carmack @mmeijeri slow at first, then very fast. def not hover. @id_aa_carmack @mmeijeri the faster, the better. gravity losses. @mcwm @chrispaine damn stonecutters! @eclecticlip was no \"company\", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize acp\\'s tzero car. no tech or ip, no employees &amp; didn\\'t even own tesla motors name. @__svndee disruption certainly. deep ai is the real risk, though, not automation. @rami_syvari @clevergoat @mor10 exactly congrats robb!  https://t.co/4oab8t0yoq @marker2002 @chrispaine so crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed @isco__ you may have heard of the person who put it together worth watching \"who killed the electric car?\" by @chrispaine. truth is indeed stranger than fiction …  https://t.co/b8rkpp8nvj @franco_fwg @zedd if zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it\\'s on @apexcornerspeed @braverock_ all superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid. @mor10 i love norway, which is the world leader in ev adoption! great example for the rest of the world. @kieranquinn27 long way to go, but we\\'ve convinced most of the auto industry to start ev programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that\\'s something nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. thought 90% prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance. since big car companies were killing their ev programs, the only chance was to create an ev company, even tho it was almost certain to fail they was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars few people know that we started tesla when gm forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard @rafaelm81 @ericaboarman that is true. ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. nothing else (legal) will get you that. @boltfinger click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music @cabbey @jeffmcadams good point, will add \"cancel nav\" to voice commands @ericidle too awesome @belltower @garthredshaw @the1manherd must ipso facto half not bee @mashabletech first of all, i cracked a long time ago. that\\'s not news. second, yes, i can see time. how did you know? @andrewhaigh yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. will make that change. @jovanik21 @philwhln just confirmed the tesla dj station works in canada @krishell1985 cool @sakerjacks no, it\\'s not! @michaelgladis yes @jeffmcadams tap cancel on the screen just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say \"play monty python\" or \"navigate home\" or anything. voice commands work pretty well. @ericaboarman just depends on whether you like a sedan or suv. sedan goes faster, suv has more room. @jschindeler yeah, coming back @symonchester coming soon! @castfxman partly @the1manherd possibly my favorite skit @angboire might work in canada too @jovanik21 @philwhln i mean also @markedtek not yet @rrosenbl yeah in the us, you can ask your tesla to play any monty python (or other comedy) skit. doesn\\'t work outside us yet. @philwhln it\\'s on the car. might add it to the tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a powerwall or tesla solar. @deandcruz my favorite for sure try the new tesla dj station on streaming radio @redletterdave the scene where brian is saved from the romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best deus ex machina moment of any movie ever @johnnyzenith all falcon heavy cores should be at the cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that @redletterdave love monty python so much  https://t.co/spuazyaxgb just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. that hurts, ok? @johnbiscevic yeah @danahull yeah these guys want us to

also, we will have a very high headcount around each gigafactory keeping it running. they just won\\'t be doing boring, repetitive tasks. @hellenomwando @markbungerlux probably closer to four or five

loved the spy who loved me  https://t.co/lar9pnj2zi @ddkilzer @irishjugg0 @macbentosh all model s and x cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months. @bigdak54 i spoke directly with the president three weeks ago about paris. many others have too. cautiously optimistic of a positive decision. @waldekkubicki @shazm01 interesting idea. would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you\\'re driving. have this in dev mode. can be a bit distracting though. @sethjacob14 early next year. to start with, we\\'re making the simplest model 3 first, like we did with s. didn\\'t do it with x, because i was an idiot. @shazm01 we could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. just need to add in the billing software. @douglasprest can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety @noradio @mcornell0 @marks22 exactly @tony_lo still on for end of year. just software limited. any tesla car with hw2 (all cars built since oct last year) will be able to do this. @freerobby @jetkohli there\\'s just no way. hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. would cost more to retrofit than trading in. @marks22 hw2. hw1 doesn\\'t have enough sensors and computing power. @harropj hopefully june for those too @macbentosh s for sure. it is a bigger car. @jetkohli i\\'d highly recommend upgrading to latest model s (which is approx version 4). only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3. @theavinashsingh maybe i\\'m misinformed, but i was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn\\'t yet exist in india to support that. @rrosenbl yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. new one is even safer, but super smooth. @ethank almost there, plus much improved web browser @kedyson1 that will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in july @ritspex almost there. probably in a few months. @bradmsimon @jonhaber you can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :) @lexiheft @hugomeister42 something cool for sure excited about the tesla autopilot software release rolling out next month. new control algorithm feels as smooth as silk. @hugomeister42 model 3, model x &amp; model s will all have same level of autopilot capability. it\\'s just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software. @songcarver wear underpants @jonhaber will do @leegrayteslafan black and

pack in model 3 at current cell/module energy densities @toddgerkens yeah @holsmichael start taking orders in april @dr_angus yeah, probably a year from now. s will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery. @akawrecks @ckalapala only model s will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles … @camkode the model s produced today is arguably version 4. let me put it this way: it is the car i will keep driving even after model 3 arrives. @bluebowles if fate is on our side, it will be amazing. will talk about that in detail next week. @juanmlemao no problem :) @djburges should be summer next year. sorry, really wish we could get rhd done sooner. we truly are working as fast as

@fredericlambert it still has one display @voltzcoreaudio nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. lots of new tech in the design and production process though. @arctechinc the more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. how often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi? @asimo3089 how about the video we just took of the first model 3 release candidate drive? @trabru yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel! @oakhaller i think so @fredericlambert @jimpengelly no, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. rwd only for early production, just like model s. @trojan81 tues/wed @jdaz because i was a dumb idiot and didn\\'t realize at the time that it would cause confusion @timothymjr tues/wed next week @skate_a_book yes. model s will always be the fastest tesla until next gen roadster, which is a few years away. @jimpengelly yes, but not until next year @alsaibie yes. hardware already on all production s and x cars. @theken_miller sorta. model 3 is like a bmw 3 series or audi a4. model s is like bmw 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + autopilot @greg525 how about now? @varunfatehpuria oh model y is coming too in a few years. kinda have to. @luciojr all tesla cars built since oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves @swindeez definitely model 3 was going to be called model e, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but ford sued to block it, so now it is s3x. totally different :) @timbeiko yes model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of model s w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. model s has more advanced technology. am noticing that many people think model 3 is the \"next version\" of a tesla, like iphone 2 vs 3. this is not true. @macwalterslives looking forward to playing the game with my kids! @aaronpaul_8 i used to be one. you\\'re welcome. trying my best, at least. hope it\\'s a bit

of appreciation to the many australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes @ah_pton16 i love wikipedia. just gets better over time. @jmmzherrera answer is complex for electric motors. we use an ac induction motor fed by a dc pack thru an igbt inverter, which kinda \"digitizes\" dc power @williamwinters high voltage dc is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. good explanation at  https://t.co/fojclhhyil ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. solar power &amp; electronics both dc. you\\'re most welcome. very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since dc to ac.  https://t.co/7uxouqf29f @mcannonbrookes just spoke with @jayweatherill, premier of south australia. very impressed. govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution. @shails yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control @mcannonbrookes $250/kwh at the pack level for 100mwh+ systems. tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products. @mcannonbrookes tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. that serious enough for you? @zedd will send you one @simonakitzu self-hatred

@mattnewby no @xuan_thai system was green for launch. i called it off. @spacecom they are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much r&amp;d risk on dragon 2, that i feel very confident of 2018. @zperrin99 uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (rp-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop tvc wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn\\'t worth rolling the dice. better to wait a day. @zybbby not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question if this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn\\'t symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause all systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. standing down to investigate. counting down to the first spacex launch from the apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast…  https://t.co/upjtcmftte spacex\\'s photo  https://t.co/imedaut3ni provided dragon 2 demo missions go well, spacex is highly confident of being able to fly us astronauts in 2018  https://t.co/usuto6qsi7 looks like we are go for launch. added an abort trigger at t-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system. investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. if ok, will launch tomorrow.  https://t.co/bqf97lywn4 @emenietti @chafkin yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren\\'t needed @sc00bs it\\'s much easier to do the cgi that way daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the cape this weekend. will be the 1st spacex flight from the apollo launch pad.  https://t.co/vr5lqjyapz @phoebecoleman i used that one :) ok, what are some good ones? will have to meter these out. hopefully, kids can\\'t die from groaning too much. @vrgtech @floydilicious they are doing india proud @osiris26 you may come to regret that request :) @littledovah yeah, exactly. so that makes it cool, right!? @floydilicious yeah, awesome achievement by isro. very impressive! apparently, there is this thing called \"dad jokes\" and i make them @ludwigmorelos you\\'re right, i can\\'t hide any more! i am irony man... @samcornwell they were earlier drafts that i accidentally published. i said the same thing a week already. in appreciation, tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited.  https://t.co/d68hnjccoq congrats to the tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop! @lollieshopmom best place to watch is on the cape causeway @seacitylight @nas2four sounds like the tesla powerwall (consumer) and powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful falcon 9 rocket now vertical at cape canaveral on launch complex 39-a. this is the same launch…  https://t.co/wy6dwrcer3 @accohen @megangeuss @arstechnica exactly. what this person said is untrue. @rusulalrubail @markruffalo @guardian please check your facts. tesla and spacex joined as soon as we received the filing, which was monday. @dknisely of course it will @sundalj should all be uploaded by next month @sureal808 motor trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the porsche 918 @voltzcoreaudio i don\\'t know what make you think that\\'s a rocket. it\\'s completely covered in a tarpaulin... george schultz and jim baker article in @wsj regarding a carbon tax  https://t.co/tf2urgms85 @batlag yes @goel_ishan hoping for summer this year @mdcdave yes, altitude improves performance for electric. opposite of combustion cars. @jovanik21 @veidit no, will be lower. wheelbase can\\'t fit 100. @jovanik21 also, tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don\\'t use it and improve performance further @veidit no plans to take x, s (or 3) above 100 kwh. semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above. @jovanik21 take out the floor mats and its 2.27. mt said everything had to be standard production. @quick_pi yes production tesla model s p100dl sets motor trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec  https://t.co/sxalqrm5ls signing off now. that was more than enough twitter trouble for one morning! @qriosity_ @mactechgenius no rare earth metals in battery @camdtor @trylks almost ready @mactechgenius app update is about two weeks out. linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. hw2 autopilot has priority. @fredericlambert yes, but model 3 is the overwhelming priority @clay_ellis i will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through africa and asia in his plane. one of my favorite things. @christesla @fredericlambert almost there. we are just being very careful with the rollout. @trylks a lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. do you really want another war? that\\'s where extremism leads. @fredericlambert yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text @cycletrades @rtoro20 people should push to have as many moderates advising the president as possible. blind hate is never the right answer. @wise1919 @fredericlambert rolling out a new update today. @recipher we should try our best @iamdeveloper really? ok, i will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. sorry for anything thoughtless. @martinengwicht @fredericlambert i just had three coffees :) @thelogicbox @ianrosswins mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on earth as we know it @seanbroswag @fredericlambert numeric @b0turner gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction @travelingmom23 i love canada! i\\'m half canadian. my mom was born in regina. my grandfather (her dad) was american, born in minnesota. @fredericlambert me too. i hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ... @brendangage i agree, great country! looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. i\\'ve heard it is incredibly beautiful. @daringkid true. me being one of them :) @marcelsalathe not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to \"1st\" place means it\\'s essentially on par @andresantoniop fair point, sorry activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise president, not fewer. how could having only extremists advise him possibly be good? @bencam137 @fifthrocket exactly @aanstadgard norway is great on all levels. love norway! @bullflags yeah. and twitter is a hater hellscape. @w4as good grief, i\\'m not \"working\" for trump. i\\'m trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction. @bittermercy @callumk24 actually, i think it\\'s kinda cool :) @erichaegler @ilexomat isn\\'t that basically like having a jury of peers? that is a default option in the us. @vladsavov those countries have strong justice systems, but i\\'d put them roughly on par with us. that rating system conflates many factors. @fifthrocket did you read my tweets? i attacked it hard. did not defend. @kenemonics you\\'re right. politics is a no-win situation. somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is. @martinengwicht also good. there are several that are on par with us. just don\\'t think any are better. people confuse laws with courts. @paulvankeep mostly anti-drug laws @zgiarrizzo exactly @thelaadams the laws need to change. judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law. @humplik the remedy for that is changing the law @callumk24 ok, but what\\'s up the wigs? @ilexomat there are many good legal systems on par with us. just don\\'t know any that are better. @biesseman true! many in america don\\'t realize how proud they should be of the legal system. not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served. walking down the street and saw this  https://t.co/mpv5j6088k @nintendomaniac @alext4627 i wish! @oldmanriver1800 then so be it. i\\'d rather do what i believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism. @bonnienorman @advandermeer wow, cool! @alext4627 that\\'s exactly what i thought. love half-life. @ana_lontana nuances are important :) 26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under d.c.  https://t.co/xfqkioesg8 @eveegdmann really don\\'t want to get in politics. i just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. feels so bizarre. @daniellebloeme yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive. in addition, i again raised climate. i believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. doing otherwise would be wrong. at my request, the agenda for yesterday\\'s white house meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost @petergleick @business first i\\'ve heard of this meeting. will find out why. @officeofomar maybe video of mit\\'s entrant into the spacex hyperloop competition. air has been removed from the  hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.  https://t.co/bap7kdkzhs minecraft  https://t.co/lu1yzjjloz @mcun1 yes. green cards &amp; dual citizens already ok. work &amp; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. this is separate from judicial action. there has already been and there will be progress on this matter regarding the meeting at the white house:  https://t.co/8b1xh4ow6h @lotte__world yes @sarahfkessler @qz headline &amp; article is misleading. i said it won\\'t be retracted (ie withdrawn by pres). it may be revoked by judicial or legislative means. @reesandersen @flixrisk yes, i believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity top ai researchers agree on principles for developing benefical ai  https://t.co/catbd4oidf @inhaleray i agree with creating great jobs, restoring us strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting @mcwm @jackclarksf yeah, sorry about that :) @jacobofamber yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material reading the source material is better than reading other people\\'s opinions about the source material  https://t.co/hkiykbdb3g @danahull strategic &amp; policy forum @danmoran3 @redletterdave exactly. there is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. it\\'s just a non-zero possibility. don\\'t know more. please read immigration order. lmk specific amendments. will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to president.  https://t.co/qlpbsp4lek @parparv it is not many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the us. they\\'ve done right,not wrong &amp; don\\'t deserve to be rejected. the blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges @miguelgamino @popsci this is silly. if adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. obv not true. and we start digging the tunnel tonight  https://t.co/uysiu0qg34 hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at spacex hq (near lax). we built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people. @suzie_official yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it\\'s getting me down. i\\'m just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it. @theskinsfactory earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. that\\'s why la can have a (lame, but getting better) subway. @_wsimson starting across from my desk at spacex. crenshaw and the 105 freeway, which is 5 mins from lax @clay_ellis yup @belovedrevol maybe next month exciting progress on the tunnel front. plan to start digging in a month or so. rex tillerson supports a carbon tax. this is what is really needed to move the needle.  https://t.co/6ne01tozs1 @michaelemann i\\'m just saying that we should see what happens first. the actions may be surprising. @michaelemann no they don\\'t @nivo0o0 was wondering what those were sigh @michael_mclean that may be a difficult award to decline tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken\" @theeconomist ... on how to address threats of climate change. they do require a global response.\" @theeconomist tillerson at his confirmation hearing: \"i think it’s important that the united states maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ... @redletterdave ok, fine. soldier 76. my dark secret is out ... @danahull i share the economist\\'s opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise @danahull rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. his team is now the usa. @theeconomist this may sound surprising coming from me, but i agree with the economist. rex tillerson has the potential to be an excellent sec of state. @dean_arexding there will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability @tsrandall 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely @stephenstohn yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. limit will raise as we get more data. @dnansink40 autonomy capability should improve via ota every 2 to 6 weeks @thesammyyyd for now @hendrikstruik the 100d price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven\\'t yet been adjusted @gdoehne @reddit yes. block 5 is the final upgrade of the falcon architecture. significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. flies end of year. @dtweiseth if we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically @dtweiseth tesla will never stop innovating. people are buying the wrong car if they expect this. there will be major revs every 12 to 18 months. @ritachung16 yes @vinnylingham unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. wish there was an easy way. giant x made of model x\\'s by tesla owners in china!  https://t.co/54wxbkikvp @gdoehne expendable. future flights will go on falcon heavy or the upgraded falcon 9. @jakebathman car won\\'t complete camera calibration. working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle. autopilot for hw2 rolling out to all hw2 cars today. please be cautious. some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service. validating a gpu driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for hw2 @ukpjd similar to spacex, the t is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the x is like a rocket trajectory @tochote our target is a 90% reduction with hw2 as the software matures @cameronrad not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by autopilot @modularlifesys @nhtsagov it might. am not sure. @gavinnwaters looking good so far. should roll out this weekend. report highlight: “the data show that the tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after autosteer installation.” final report on autopilot issued by @nhtsagov is very positive  https://t.co/ksozsrr3l9 @visakanv one million falcon before launch  https://t.co/qqxvtbijof @fellipec not the ideal ending @olivierw4 there will be many improvements to hw1 over the course of the year @craighamnett yes @brian_ashcraft yeah, it has a lot of potential rewatched \"ghost in the shell\" and the end of \"colossus: the forbin project\"  https://t.co/zvur5rze5c hw2 autopilot now downloading to all hw2 cars, but in non-actuating mode to assess reliability. if looks good, actuation by end of week. @jimdekort @spacex rotates 180 degrees and does a retro burn @jimdekort @spacex it does liftoff  https://t.co/pcvjovfhy2 all satellites deployed mission looks good. started deploying the 10 iridium satellites. rocket is stable on the droneship. @brandonr182 @sama have you tried steam engines? they are amazing. @motortrend sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test @gurnam @brianstucki @reddit it is @jrmygrnbrgr hopefully, early next week. results from limited release look good so far. trying our best to be super careful. @trevoclark good point. 2.34 would be a production tesla. stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1. @robsmallshire @claremacraeuk it will promising early results from the ludricrous easter egg. looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (motor trend spec) might be achievable... @mjreddymd if the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all hw1 and to all hw2 early next week @redletterdave the least cool characters...it\\'s embarrassing @mbhnyc it will in an upcoming release later this year @teslamotors tesla\\'s approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. primarily vision w radar &amp; sonar. @matt_mantyla @teslamotors increasing capacity at existing supercharger locations now has top priority. some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty. @olivierw4 longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. will raise after full fleet data rolls in. if all looks good, hw2 autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000 new rev for autopilot hw2 rolling out mon to first 1000 &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. also improves hw1 and enables ludicrous+. @fatihorhan @spacex that was a great game @pensasoda  https://t.co/6ies7xbubs via @wired hold-down firing of @spacex falcon 9 at vandenberg air force completed. all systems are go for launch next week. hw2 autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week. @vicentes @dragtimes late jan, along with linux kernel upgrade @dragtimes yes, but held up by autopilot . it def works tho in shaving 0.1 sec off 0-60mph &amp; 1/4 mile. if ap goes tmrw, then perf upgrade goes thurs. resolving an autopilot hw2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. if that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw. churchill (non) quotes   https://t.co/ava4yd6k6g @andrewket almost there. undergoing final validation. might go out in next few days. deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends @quipme occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future @djsearle @fredericlambert yes, grid won\\'t be needed for moderate use superchargers in non-snowy regions @fredericlambert a mere 350 kw ... what are you referring to, a children\\'s toy? @yamenalhaddad brain is full right now and that\\'s a hard one @fredericlambert there are some installed already, but full rollout really needs supercharger v3 and powerpack v2, plus solarcity. pieces now in place. @ddaogaru if you don\\'t like the p100dl, you can give it back @wpconner good idea @mwangltg yes @sweenschris should complete in 2017. one is def planned for swift current, near my cousin\\'s wheat farm where i had my 18th bday. @darkdude203 it is keyed off the volume of music in the car. if you turn that down w left scroll wheel, it will be quieter. @cmaggiore50 typing mars after holding down the t symbol on the center console works on s and x. also try renaming your car 42. make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. will update over its cell connection too, but takes much longer. to activate the model x holiday performance, just type holidays or modelxmas after pressing the logo. also, mars.  https://t.co/8cy7yplecx @cjdsb looking promising for next week @pcwizardllc no major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads @jelleprins some years away, but yes @pcwizardllc will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign @thebeazles night is easy. twilight is hardest. @vicentes that is actually rolling out to all model x\\'s right now @vicentes yes @samlawrence 8.1, which hopefully goes out next week. @dragtimes hoping for next week. also going through validation. looks like we might be ready to rollout most of autopilot functionality for hw2 towards the end of next week tesla receives highest owner satisfaction score of any carmaker in consumer reports survey  https://t.co/npjykz8mga tesla autopilot vision neural net now working well. just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of environments. @slackmds in work @adrianvolts @teslamotors @teslamotorsclub @teslarati tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. getting close. @chromejs10 should start changing soon i am actually going to do this @teslamotors we are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. if the site is basically deserted, no problem to park. boring, it\\'s what we do it shall be called \"the boring company\" traffic is driving me nuts. am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging... @loic you too :) @loic you\\'re right, this is becoming an issue. supercharger spots are meant for charging, not parking. will take action. forming a rocket nozzle  https://t.co/qrpcvyhaxr a life well lived

unaffiliated shareholders in favor of the tesla/solarcity merger! thanks for believing. @contra_9077 sounds right @arminkeyani all p100d vehicles produced to date, as well as new. this is purely a software optimization. model x numbers should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile looks like the model s p100d easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month @austenallred wow, thanks. we won\\'t let you down. @id_aa_carmack we could enable that, although the cameras use grey, grey, grey, red detection, so it would look a

@mykalsocal @bbc_topgear @teslamotors loving this thread :) @balaji_kann primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. b pillar has a glass overlay. @bittermercy excellent safety in

skipped the disabled spot @bret_with1t yes @teslamotors 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonars and radar all flush mounted and body color. beauty remains. tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban

@scrappydog yes. this seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. dragon would have been fine. finishing autopilot blog postponed to  end of weekend loss of

spacex droneship ocisly  https://t.co/i0qq2d3bte @dfjsteve very similar. the crush core in the falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard. crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. easy to replace (if falcon makes it back to port). rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. prob ok, but some risk of tipping. satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. all looks good. 3 mins to launch  https://t.co/i5jnds9mco @spacex there was a tiny glitch in the

important to minimize gravity losses. may need to increase size of rocket storage hangar woohoo!!  https://t.co/0p8n8vmfbr rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but i\\'d recommend ordering a model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery @samsamlee777 yes filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. wd like to credit larry page with turning me on to this. bioweapon defense mode is real  https://t.co/xgnlroyhaq this is what happens when you turn it on:  https://t.co/lnkhzxtxqn @mactechgenius @sacev have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. slowed things down temporarily, but it\\'s for the best. @johanmancus historical precedent. mars vehicle will be metric. @sacev next month (with a lot of other good stuff) @scottymeuk @dericlew @spaceflightins @phillipcjackson exactly @_andyoneal sides def, center maybe @cyberdinex naturally falcon heavy thrust will be 5.1m lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. it\\'s a beast... f9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71m lbf later this year. it is capable of 1.9m lbf in flight. @elonmusk f9 leo payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg @lukealization no cross feed. it would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers. @lukealization no physical changes to the engine. this thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. it is just tougher than we thought. @elonmusk max performance numbers are for expendable launches. subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload. @mattyteare basically current, but higher throttle setting. good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin. just posted latest max payload capabilities of falcon 9 and heavy  https://t.co/z45y5v7g91 @dannysparker yes @phillipcjackson turns out it doesn\\'t need securing @mini_elon yes @vicentes @gdoehne yes, several times @jbdeck for sure :) @tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly @rokbottomgamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items. @vivekmgeorge zuck doesn\\'t (yet) have a deep tech understanding of ai. i spend hours every week being educated by world\\'s best researchers. @gdoehne jcsat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. next land landing in a few months. @mrboylan system scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. those have been purged. @vigneshraju of course @maya_kazan temporary spike in some areas due to x 3rd row seat recall. should be sorted by june. @mrboylan duplicates will be cancelled. max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely. @erothenberg simple answer is that there just aren\\'t many used teslas available. demand &gt;&gt; supply. @erothenberg checking into it ... @romn8tr will definitely do so @abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. that\\'s the value of having a pica-3 heat shield with propulsive landing. @cardoso it could land on venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. tough local environment. but wouldn\\'t recommend transporting astronauts beyond earth-moon region. wouldn\\'t be fun for longer journeys. internal volume ~size of suv. dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. red dragon mars mission is the first test flight. @kristiannairn a 3 should be workable, but an s or particularly an x would be better @scottmcnealy that article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. wager right now that sun has received far more than tesla? looks like model x resale value is holding up well :)  https://t.co/4gedy9gcha @dannysparker aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10x refiring of a returned booster @realdarthbl we have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of qa. several parts being replaced as a result. by land and sea  https://t.co/c5qwfny99r

https://t.co/fzuaxsjlr7 godot  https://t.co/bict4amvaz full play  https://t.co/kjznbeuufa have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of waiting for godot. we so often wait, without

for psychedelic cowbell road. and, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon. @drew @spacex not from us, but it\\'s awesome @thelonelyisland well, i thought tli might be upset about using their material without permission. apparently not :) @thehackersnews @spacex thanks @rjcc yes @levie tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and mars will be a lot less than people think. just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported tesla, spacex &amp; solarcity over the years. thank you. @potus thanks on behalf of an amazing team at spacex! @jon_favreau @spacex thanks! @nasa @sgvcrime @spacex @space_station thanks for your support! looking forward to delivering the goods for you. screen cap from the stern cam of droneship \"of course i still love you\"  https://t.co/4rgojmtzvn @arstechnica reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. getting to space needs none. solarcity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire tesla fleet  https://t.co/bn4lrzii1v @nonesuchzach nickel is also in nickels @nonesuchzach battery uses no rare earth metals. main ingredient is nickel, which is what\\'s used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic. over 325k cars or ~$14b in preorders in first week. only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation. @samboykin @danahull the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid @jpfrappier yes, will go all the way to alaska @recode dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. no time to rehearse &amp; don\\'t want to read from a prompter. @maximumblue we will @laurenshearer1 doesn\\'t sound right. will check into it. @mthorpxxi we are working on enlarging the opening. aperture will be big enough for almost anything. most telling is that the spacex propulsion cto switched from driving a porsche 911 turbo s to a model x model x review  https://t.co/is2zbgdlqn @brianmrtz probably unwise @christiano92 @inspron @jerry22499879 won\\'t be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height @stevehurd yes @jerry22499879 yes @qa2198 @teslamotors yes @goesazedo yes @morganpage sounds good signing off from impromptu twitter ama. thanks for the suggestions. btw, we really will have more cow bells. @lordsshrivas coming soon for all tesla cars. just an ota software update. @gonzalobolio yes, coming this year @amarnathrevanna air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height @gatorwass you can do that now with s and x. will be same for 3. @_elombardo @rjpryan correct @eduardoforneck hopefully 0.21 @peteehmkay @gerardomarina what\\'s the link to that? @tapwin no, but we will need to build a factory in europe to serve long-term regional demand as fremont reaches max capacity. @mpatfield no problem @crackedupcorson will cover whole country hopefully this year @andersrytter yes, but production awd will be a lot faster @alexbelohlavek less @torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. traction control is way better than a normal awd. digital vs analog. and, of course, it will have more cowbells. model 3 will be rwd, with dual motor awd optional. even rwd will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of tesla drivetrain. @golfshard yes @zooropa88 @teslamotors superchargers and service centers will cover all of italy later this year @_only_hawk @michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter definitely @alandbru @teslamotors should be addressed this year @cmaxvs only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. a bike will still fit no problem. @ikrivetko that\\'s not the real steering system @b_rans yes. will easily fit two child seats. three if you buy slim seats. @gerardomarina some tweaking underway @hbl_cosmin wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. it feels like a spaceship. @michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter won\\'t happen. reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues. @scottkelley99 edge and contour refinement are ongoing. even .1mm matters. @_amwolo_ they can. will be great for road trips and camping @bvalvsracing it will make sense after part 2 of the model 3 unveil a model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally. in general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome @ryancasburn we always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. loyalty begets loyalty. @snoozethroughf1 there will be an optional tow hitch. @rgspan our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non x/s customers to receive the credit. @jeffrey @neutyp matte black was surprisingly popular. probably makes sense to bring it to production. @waltnew cool, thanks! @mindthreat @ryanhummer yes, if the trend continues, before 276k model 3 orders by end of sat model 3 design sketches  https://t.co/p5ucobruz7 @grebakshay we are working on an exact date, but tesla will be in india before 3 production starts. @model3owners they will. we spent a lot of time on those. @vicentes roadster, s and x customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. they deserve a lot of credit. @aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines @raytech247 yes, within a region. can\\'t deliver to all regions simultaneously. too much complexity. @squallcraft and a few other things token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. gifts on order. @34thrain maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. no one at tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil. will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on wed for the full week. all efforts focused on accelerating the ramp. 253k as of 7am this morning @sundarpichai thanks! now 232k orders @grahamablair of course :) @jbourquee giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night. @steveagee def on the cards for the future @jacklipstone should be within a week or two max @alyssa_milano hi alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in tesla. i hope you have a great experience with the car. definitely going to need to rethink production planning... thought it would slow way down today, but model 3 order count is now at 198k. recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly. model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5b in a day. future of electric cars looking bright! @indiatoday will include india-wide supercharger network @oatmeal sure! @startuprabbi coming in the mail @redletterdave hardware in all cars. autopilot safety features standard. convenience features optional (like s and x). @drew just order the spacex option package! thanks for tuning in to the model 3 unveil part 1! part 2 is super next level, but that\\'s for later… @lukealization yes, will cover whole country @preastro yes @kentnstephens sure is @roddrury x and s will also be available adding several more countries to model 3 order page tonight. check for details, but will include india, brazil, sa, sk, nz, sing &amp; ireland. model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person online ordering at  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr will now open at 7:30pm pacific to ensure no server overload. presentation still at 8:30. @haerone from almost anywhere @gifteddiego coming soon! incredibly inspired by the interest in model 3. you won\\'t be disappointed. also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up. model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm california time at  https://t.co/46txqrrsdr @rossbin you will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve. tomorrow is part 1 of the model 3 unveil. part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production. model 3 order day starting in australia  https://t.co/t6aung5bcv you can now buy cruise ship tickets for the arctic passage. seeing is believing.  https://t.co/lhkupknmfc great article by @badastronomer. important to note max

https://t.co/9tei7lu4fd @milehighwilly being fixed @robglaser sure @mikegaalsf turn off recirc. air exits thru rear vents. snap in shade also avail from service, but i just tint the rear window. @christianlguaje no the aei meeting wasn\\'t secret and i was only there for a few hours to talk about mars and sustainable energy. nothing to do with trump. congrats to deepmind! many experts in the field thought ai was 10 years away from achieving this.  https://t.co/5ggzzkud3k spacex &amp; tesla comp is same or better than other companies. big diff is that we don\\'t outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service. spacex and tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory.   https://t.co/y8s4udmf5z @wk057 @teslamotors wasn\\'t done at my request. good hacking is a gift. rocket landed hard on the droneship. didn\\'t expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance. target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. thanks @ses_satellites for riding on falcon 9! looking forward to future missions. @astro_valdric @teslamotors we spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation. .@curtismcauliff spacex has not donated to any presidential campaign evolution hasn\\'t advanced much  https://t.co/tsgmvtgyxh mit technology review 2016  https://t.co/db7qzrmgh5 @chrisdbond checking ... @lorengrush exactly :) pushing launch to friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic  https://t.co/gr8t5upald @pernillet only heard about it today. doesn\\'t sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor. @spacex launch aborted on low thrust alarm. rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm. @spacex af has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. scrambling helo to get them to move. @tlkfremont great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo. @derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. best not to have vented seats w kids though. @skiesforme can\\'t emphasize enough that white is the best interior. also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7. @skiesforme @teslamotors that said, the white interior is the best. highly recommend. @skiesforme heavy use of the white causes splitting. adding backing material to strengthen. will be upgraded at no cost. worth reposting the wait but why piece on ai. we are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.  https://t.co/1c30zwrxq1 next gen atlas robot  https://t.co/uklqidxrvd @romclocko @teslamotors coming later this year there is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%. global economy of $100t is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so imf estimate of $5t or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude just wanted to thank stu g for  https://t.co/7flnbruwpl. know it meant a lot to you. will take good care. @nathanfielder don\\'t you already have a spaceship?  https://t.co/tfnm43song worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs  https://t.co/4li5e013dj sigh …  https://t.co/velozakiw6

episodes my coffee tastes unusually good this morning  https://t.co/lowwupagoz @basseye @tegmark yes interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. that\\'s basically what formulas are. @chriskreidler @engadget yes, this was done jointly with tesla and radio flyer this baby model s really is quite fun   https://t.co/40w5ss5bki more details on model 3 unveil in coming weeks. that\\'s it for now. @mysteryguitarm yes no signature series for model 3. same reservation amount for all. @garethseneque global model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in tesla stores on march 31 and online april 1 @erikroesegg good point should mention that tesla motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. this was completely independent. love this tesla video made by  https://t.co/bwkne0mzuh my job moonlighting as a police officer in brazil is no longer secret  https://t.co/qbtqympaf9 must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention @theeconomist interesting name @benzinga i didn\\'t take anyone\\'s car and never would. car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold. my best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more ruds to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017 @jeffbezos @spacex thanks jeff falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn\\'t latch on one the four legs, causing it…  https://t.co/dpxsrqwal9 @stunt_penguin @layon_overwhale stage 1 would reach low earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced. @jimmyvosika actually, didn\\'t get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed. if speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. with a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h. ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. just not physically possible to return to launch site as mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. altitude &amp; distance don\\'t mean much for orbit. all about speed. @mbhnyc steel collet well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! won\\'t be last rud, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.  https://t.co/w007tccanj @uncle_gus probably however, that was not what prevented it being good. touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn\\'t latch, so it tipped over after landing. definitely harder to land on a ship. similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that\\'s also translating &amp; rotating. maybe some debris ingestion. engine data looks ok. will borescope tonight. this is one of the outer engines. conducted hold-down firing of returned falcon rocket. data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations. next launch is a @nasa science mission from vafb california on sunday.  https://t.co/vjdkjkzzg1

the content. cool!  https://t.co/hoe0k7qkuk @anakinsge hopefully, mid to late next year. we are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time. @gangsofgtown given high local demand, a gigafactory in india would probably make sense in the long term. @abrax4s yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in mexico now. official launch in next several months. @javashri auto import duties are prohibitively high. hoping for a special category for evs. most of our discussion was about batteries. @roneijlander we just finished building a huge expansion in tilburg! these are all things i\\'ve said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here. model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. a china factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. a factory in europe wd happen for same reason. my comments in china weren\\'t transcribed correctly. tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in ca &amp; nv as far into future as i can imagine. @jessicatetreau important to set ac to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which tesla service can provide @shanenickerson amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. would cost less and work better with a new car. autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning! regulatory approvals received, so autopilot rolling out to all countries! (excluding japan, which is still under review) @jarkkokuoppala all @backseatdiver hoping for friday release @elonmusk good feedback. will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks. what esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 ui overhaul? or new features entirely? @salmaneei already in jordan. rest of states in region next year. @bonnienorman thanks bonnie :) @m4xrodri planning to have a big opening in mexico city soon and then proceed gradually to central and south america. @octomagon me too: @jonthomason yay!

thought world wd take action sooner. no time for subtlety @1sthubblefan @keithwarren exactly in reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change  http://t.co/soqcnjb61b climate change deniers claim \"scientists disagree\", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades good article on \"climate change\" vs \"global warming\" referred by @forresttanaka  http://t.co/d1s4rj0qus was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. harder to breathe as i got older, so time to fix. had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. probably shouldn\\'t be tweeting :) sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside @cosmicrami awesome. we really need to promote that fact in the us. a co2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt! would love to do a pickup truck. something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque. technically, i \"got rich\" from zip2 &amp; paypal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into spacex, tesla &amp; solarcity. if consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. we should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds. @ponder68 carbon produced by a @spacex rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. no, we should not be exempt. net of gas savings, a tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. maybe less costly then it first seems. yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. market will then achieve best solution. trees are net consumers of co2, so technically we would pay them money :) exactly. seems crazy to risk the co2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway. big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). much better to emphasize the latter. @maxmberger the collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator. me &amp; other private money funded tesla for first 7 years, got ipo+ govt money for 3, now paid back. yes, carbon tax would be a better way. @grayj_ there should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census. weight of scientific evidence. taxes don\\'t ban a purchase, they just increase cost. am against bans, except in extreme cases. exactly. better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. let market decide. perhaps. i am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad. great article on tesla-dealer battle by leilani munter (@carbonfreegirl), who lives in nc  http://t.co/pveme5pevn @varung_ belief in climate change isn\\'t necessary. even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax. @karlbrauer making rockets @tonykatz don\\'t like having a zillion tweets in the log. makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history. @sapientcapital we created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. still isn\\'t. and, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on earth simply to delay sustainable energy? those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong  http://t.co/s7foirly6b more importantly, @chrysler failed to pay back $1.3b. apart those 2 points, you were totally 1st  http://t.co/0p2zldl67a as many have already noted, @chrysler is a division of fiat, an italian company. we specifically said first *us* company. interview with @bloombergnews about tesla and doe loan gets into some of the details  http://t.co/xb0jvophnc tesla wired the funds to repay the doe loan today. only us car company to have fully repaid govt  http://t.co/jxhw9ykvpz @gizmoman0 physics @yes_andre i\\'m a big fan of ultracapacitors. was going to do my phd at stanford on them. but we need a breakthrough in energy density... @mcbartvolgers @spacex high pressure helium pneumatic bolts and pistons. no explosives. @xyrth cool, will get one plus another chicken @talulahriley you\\'re welcome. it did seem like the chicken of destiny xx petting zoo left a chicken behind at the park. now we have a pet chicken. @danabrunetti soon model s will feature druidic dwarves dancing around a miniature stone henge @danabrunetti well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :) supercharger announcement pushed to next week. something else this week. @bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history. @vicorly yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the model s @malkosh we do @itsokayyouknow harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change btw, vast majority of credit for solarcity should go to lyndon &amp; peter rive &amp; their awesome team. i\\'m just a small part. @seanchin @raimisj over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things). improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. not sales constrained. @annabananastand it can do hands free right now. being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add... @enggirl mostly water or coffee at home. when i\\'m out, will have macallan neat or vodka with something. @danielmarshal15 it can dig up almost anything. @jasonpolstein yeah, we don\\'t do a good job of telling people about this feature. requires hardware unfortunately. @grimmerkimmer @dpinsen given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story  http://t.co/lwr3godxbg @raimisj tesla software knits together google voice, slacker, gracenote &amp; others and streams over 3g (will be lte later) @dpinsen people tell me cory johnson is a shill for the shorts. don\\'t know if true, but he sure behaves that way. would also recommend the cheese shop, spam or fish license by monty python. hold down voice button &amp; say \"play amish paradise by weird al yankovic\". model s can play almost any song via internet. @realbhuwan don\\'t forget the mystery announcement. part 5 of the trilogy. there is a way for the tesla model s to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank. @howardreiter totally agree. tesla will circle back and do something cool for roadsters next year. @mjasandoval stay tuned just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on tesla through the long, dark night. we wouldn\\'t be here without you. @westcoastbill thanks bill! am a fan of larry, sergey &amp; google in general, but self-driving cars comments to bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. no big announcement here tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is model s, model x, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck @rebel_sal exactly creating an autopilot for cars at tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. still a few years from production. @djfrustration tested it myself this weekend and was working well. some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request. anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at tesla, please apply! chris porritt from aston martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at tesla  http://t.co/mnuiwdxoxt @bdcs yup, it is super far. moon is basically in our back yard relative to mars. @nirdthebird definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. too expensive in most places. @detlefkroeze yeah, that probably makes sense. @douglasbullard @teslamotors most people have never heard of nikola tesla. that will hopefully change over time. @flyguynscc @teslamotors yes, that has been the goal from the beginning @fink_justin it can definitely strain relationships, but i loved doing my first company with my brother @vangsgutane norway rocks! @wehbyjammin earnings call next week, then supercharger week after and then... the mystery announcement/demonstration :) @teslatrip you\\'re welcome :) @thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces tx lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee. @rocco_thestreet guaranteeing the world\\'s best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. why isn\\'t that good? @chriscowan_  chris is great. took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system. am getting lots of questions about the big supercharger announcement. aiming to do that the week after next. @stoneymonster yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. should help all owners. tesla raises model s resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry  http://t.co/l5loxtyp33 @yatpay side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + florida is heavily populated. landing permission tricky :) @pataneous we can\\'t formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but i feel confident about the value anyway. @2552nsf yeah, that is super tricky. will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform. @rebel_sal yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. new financing is not perfect, but much better. @alan_nestos the legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy @darma_setia more likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of hell. clarkson doesn\\'t understand technology. @jsonberland we did a ton of testing until they could handle 4x legally required impact energy. extremely tough. @bigballi high pressure helium. needs to be ultra light. all 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than model s. f9r (pronounced f-niner) shows a little leg. design is a nested, telescoping piston w a frame.  http://t.co/h49tss2cyl @roulezelectric this is about getting a prior announcement right. not part 4 yet. time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). tesla announcement tomorrow. @astrostephenson we\\'re aiming for late 2015, but nasa needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. would do the same @melissamontoyao anne\\'s role is launch site engineering. don\\'t think she has anything against media -- just not her role. @realbhuwan @teslamotors cool :) @rebel_sal just read it. good piece. @realtomlangel maybe a v long time from now. paying div is a sign that a company cannot find good ways to spend money. @wfww our software is requesting the right song, but slacker has a bug in their code. supposed to be fixed by tomorrow. @eirene_inc @sciam interesting piece auto dealer sterling mccall makes the case for tesla direct sales in texas  http://t.co/jchete0d2l congrats to @virgingalactic and @richardbranson on supersonic test flight! first test of the falcon 9-r

@tcmeggs this argument is a bit silly. a city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn\\'t traffic. @nycomwireless @teslamotors cool, thanks for buying our car! @tapp697 thanks, important clarification. tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. market follows eventually. announcement of new @teslamotors strategy tomorrow. tesla owners will like this. @wheelseditor cool. just read and watched! seems to be some stormy weather over in shortville these days @rocketrichardp @ct_la exactly. dmv comm overruled good recommendation of hearing officer. @trekker56 @teslamotors please contact dmv commissioner and governor. this is not good for the people of virginia. not all good news. virginia dmv commissioner just denied tesla a dealer license, despite hearing officer being in favor. @in_sight_full @juliewestfall we have great neighbors! @themilns try this:  http://t.co/uvhbe2umli wringing water out of a towel in zero g is way trippy

influence of the dealer lobby. new york judge states: \"... dealers cannot utilize the franchised dealer act as a means to sue their competitors\". exactly! new york judge just ruled in favor tesla, dismissing the legal attack by auto dealers to prevent direct sales! yay for democracy! @latimes asks: should tesla motors be able to sell directly to consumers?  http://t.co/ihsnht6bgx @twittelator yup, you\\'re right just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in austin. will hang around after press conf to thank people in person. @derrickgott007 already partly here with

risk of losing more \"cool points\", i like reagan too! however, i also like obama, clinton &amp; jfk. good people on both sides... @ticeestes am not trying to accumulate cool points. she was far from perfect, but her actions, on balance, were good. @richardmatthias her later years are debatable, but her early years are not imo. britain went from dreary to great again. always admired margaret

improbability drive :) today\\'s tesla announcement is actually the 2nd in a 5 part trilogy (love douglas adams) @mpauldine you never know ... @stopman thanks michael. beauty of over the air software updates is that the product keeps improving even after you buy it. @jeremys thanks jeremy! good seeing you in la. awesome job with yelp! to be clear, tesla is in california, so it is not april

advance the field.   short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems.   ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence. everything to the moon! we are honored to be part of the @nasaartemis team 🚀🖤💫 nasa rules!! 💫🖤🚀 👀 🎸🎸 austin rocks!! 🎸 🎸 @model3owners same with berlin @model3owners limited production of model y this year, high volume next year @model3owners i was just there, driving cybertruck around the site where it will be built! make life multiplanetary! #mars @erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an rv or truck in motion. we need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades. @thesheetztweetz this is accurate. service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. probably out of beta this summer. @sadiaslayy @dogecoinbets 😮 @lexfridman one of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary! @austinbarnard45 aiming to launch next week @billhuang688 @rationaletienne @f9block5 certainly one of the largest. a company whose name rhymes with shmoogle is pretty far ahead.   but i think we’re the leader in shallow-minded ai haha! doge barking at the moon  https://t.co/qfb81d7zol @wsbchairman doge barking at the moon – miro  https://t.co/1vtm2xousy @rationaletienne @f9block5 while perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world ai. that is what tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.  unless a company is good at ai with tight compute, it’s hopeless. this is insanely hard. le petit prince ☾             🔭𖨆♡ @spacexmr soon it will be real @janixos @ercxspace @spacex actually, yes. and red rocket truck stop. @andyweedman @karpathy @dirtytesla stop … in the name of love!  https://t.co/kbsti5jz16 @austinteslaclub @tslacc @teslaquadcities @teslaownersvn @sjvtesla @teslaownersebay @codingmark @billhuang688 @gailalfa1 @tesla 🥰 @teslarati i found some footage of the drive  https://t.co/txelqo9spr @astrojordy @dogeofficialceo @f9block5 insanely cute! @wholemarsblog button timing of may is aspirational. depends on how well limited beta of v9.0 goes, but i would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than june. fsd subscription next month is a sure thing. @cliffski @f9block5 hopefully addressed this summer @dogeofficialceo @f9block5 🤣🤣 @blkmdl3 @f9block5 same timing @f9block5 major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. beta button hopefully next month.  this is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. production autopilot is already above that for highway driving. @jrosinski97 will investigate @melaniemadri probably late july tesla ai/autopilot engineering is awesome! making excellent progress solving real-world ai. @ercxspace @spacex 69th raptor engine coming soon @ashleevance maybe it’s about how you use it @ppathole @swiftonsecurity getting there @astrojordy @ppathole @spacex @tesla that version of falcon 1 never flew, so must be ~2004. the cad looks so simple! i think we were still using solidworks back then. @eugenelee3 @ppathole @spacex @tesla yeah, not scalable. my grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level. @ppathole @spacex @tesla that was my night job. day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at pinnacle research. @ppathole @spacex @tesla true. ancient times … had to flip cpu registers explicitly, as computer was so slow. @erdayastronaut @tesla absolutely @erdayastronaut @tesla tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. tesla insurance will make it smooth sailing.'"

        "This study aims to explore the impact of Elon Musk's tweets related to Tesla on the stock prices of the company. As one of the wealthiest and most influential individuals globally, Musk's remarks on significant matters often generate widespread attention and debate. It is thus logical to presume that his statements shape investor behavior, potentially leading to a noticeable impact on the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "After carefully analyzing the tweets from Elon Musk, extracting their sentiment and studying their relationship with the stock prices of Tesla, we have found that indeed some stock movements are caused by Musk.\n",
        "\n",
        "We see that very popular tweets (above-average likes, comments and retweets) cause an almost immediate stock price drop or price increase. A great example is what happens in August 2018, when Elon Musk tweets about his idea of taking Tesla private. The reaction of the market is almost immediate and it has consequences in the short term: Musk's tweet pushed Tesla's stock price more than 13% above the prior day's close.  However, effects usually do not last long, since by August 17, 2018 dropped 11% below where it was before the tweet because investors were doubting if he actually could pull off the deal. Moreover, we have seen that later he tweeted again in August regarding this deal (“I’m excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors, plus Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Munger, Tolles & Olson as legal advisors, on the proposal to take Tesla private”) making prices plunge even more.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it is true that in order to be able to forecast a pricing model, taking into account the tweets of Elon Musk would not be sufficient, since the relationship is not strong enough in the long term and it is not possible to forecast trends. Building a more complex and dynamic model that includes a comprehensive web scraping process, processes Tesla news and tweets in real time while applying other forecasting statistical methods would be necessary.\n"

        "This is a great starting point to create a model that uses real time web scraping to analyze market stock prices. In order to improve this project we would start by finding a way to have access to the Twitter data warehouse, which we have found is possible but time to obtain the license is uncertain. We would complete an extensive research that analyzes not only Elon’s Tweets but also other big influences that might impact the firm stock price.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project we have manually created a bag of words, another next step would be to automate this process and create a model that includes machine learning and is able to label and weight words and sentences as positive, neutral or negative, completing an exhaustive sentiment analysis. This would make the model more dynamic and complete, since it would be updated constantly and would include newly created words used by the common population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, once we obtain an intelligent model capable of analyzing news and social media, we would include statistical parameters that would allow us to quantify relationships, correlations and, finally, compute an accurate forecast or identify mispricings in stocks. If the model was fast enough to find misprices (overvaluations and undervaluations) it would give the investor the opportunity to explode that opportunity.\n"
